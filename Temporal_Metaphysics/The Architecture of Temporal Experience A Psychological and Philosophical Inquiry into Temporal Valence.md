# **The Architecture of Temporal Experience: A Psychological and Philosophical Inquiry into Temporal Valence**

## **Part I: Foundational Frameworks of Valence and Time**

### **Section 1: The Nature of Valence: Beyond Good and Bad**

The concept of valence—the quality of being good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, desirable or aversive—serves as a fundamental building block in affective science, motivation, and decision-making.1 It is the primary dimension around which the human meaning system is organized, allowing for rapid, efficient evaluation of the environment.3 However, a nuanced understanding reveals that valence is not a monolithic construct. It is a complex, multi-layered phenomenon that can be indexed through distinct psychological systems. Distinguishing between these facets of valence is a critical prerequisite for understanding its intricate relationship with the temporal dimensions of human experience. This section deconstructs the concept of valence, moving from a foundational dichotomy to a more complex, multifaceted model derived from appraisal theories.

#### **1.1 The Foundational Dichotomy: Affective vs. Semantic Valence**

The most crucial distinction within the study of valence is between its affective and semantic representations.1 These two modes, while highly correlated in everyday experience, represent fundamentally different ways of indexing an object or event's value.1

- **Affective Valence** is a property of an emotional response. It is the immediate, experiential, and embodied quality of pleasure or displeasure that occurs in response to a stimulus.3 It is a change in one's state—a feeling—that indexes an event as desirable or not. For example, the joy and pleasure experienced while actively playing with a friendly puppy constitute a positive affective valence.1 This form of valence is event-related and time-dependent, meaning it is most fully accessible in temporal proximity to the eliciting event.3
- **Semantic Valence** is a form of conceptual knowledge. It refers to the stored, accumulated information about an object or event's value, independent of a current emotional response.1 It is the knowledge that playing with the puppy is
  *usually* fun, a fact that can be accessed and utilized for decision-making even when one is not currently experiencing any pleasure.1 This representation allows individuals to categorize events as positive or negative without any corresponding change in feelings, facial expressions, or autonomic activation.1

This distinction is not merely academic; it has profound evolutionary significance. The ability to represent valence semantically enables planning, communication, and decision-making about future behavior without the need to simultaneously experience a full-blown emotional response.3 One can know that a snake is dangerous (negative semantic valence) and plan to avoid its habitat without having to constantly feel fear.

Historically, the term "valence" in affective science was first used to denote this semantic dimension. Early researchers like Osgood referred to valence as a latent dimension of semantic meaning, while Russell used it to indicate the cognitive structure of affect in language.1 Only later was the term adopted to describe the conscious, experiential dimension of feelings.1 This evolution underscores both the deep connection and the potential for confusion between these two modes of representing value.

The separation of affective and semantic valence is fundamental to understanding complex human behaviors, particularly those involving self-regulation. Many of the challenges of human life, from resisting temptation to pursuing long-term goals, can be framed as a conflict between these two systems. Consider the act of studying for a difficult exam. The immediate, moment-to-moment experience may be characterized by frustration, boredom, or anxiety—a clear instance of negative affective valence. However, the student persists because the semantic valence associated with passing the exam (e.g., career advancement, sense of accomplishment, social approval) is strongly positive. The capacity to allow behavior to be guided by the abstract, semantic representation of a distant outcome, in direct opposition to a potent and immediate affective state, is the very essence of successful self-regulation and delayed gratification. Consequently, failures of self-regulation, such as procrastination, can be conceptualized as situations where the immediate negative affective valence of the task overpowers the more distant positive semantic valence of the goal.

#### **1.2 A Multifaceted View: Appraisal Theories of Valence**

Moving beyond the simple positive-negative axis, appraisal theories of emotion propose a more granular, multifaceted view of valence. These theories posit that emotions, and their associated valence, emerge from a sequence of subjective evaluations (appraisals) of an event based on multiple criteria.2 This perspective suggests that "valence" is not a single feeling but a composite outcome of several distinct evaluative processes.

The Component Process Model (CPM), developed by Klaus Scherer, is a prominent example of this approach. It identifies several key appraisal criteria that can be considered different "types" of valenced outcomes 2:

1. **Pleasantness/Hedonic Experience:** This is the most basic form of valence, referring to the intrinsic, sensual pleasantness or unpleasantness of a stimulus. It is the evaluation of an event's immediate hedonic quality, aligning closely with the concept of affective valence.2
2. **Goal Conduciveness:** This appraisal evaluates whether an event or situation helps or hinders the achievement of one's goals and needs. An event that facilitates a goal is assigned a positive valence, while one that obstructs it is assigned a negative valence. While pleasantness and goal conduciveness often co-occur, they are distinct; a bitter-tasting medicine (unpleasant) may be highly conducive to the goal of getting well (positive).2
3. **Power/Coping Potential:** This involves appraising one's ability to control or influence a situation. A high degree of perceived power or control contributes a positive valence, while a sense of powerlessness or low control contributes a negative valence.2
4. **Self-Congruence and Normative Significance:** These appraisals evaluate an event's compatibility with one's self-concept and with internal or external moral standards. An action that is congruent with one's self-image or is deemed morally good has a positive valence, whereas an incongruent or immoral action has a negative valence.2

This multifaceted framework is critical for understanding temporal valence because different temporal distances may cause different appraisal criteria to become more salient. For instance, when contemplating a distant future event, an individual might primarily evaluate it based on its goal conduciveness (an abstract criterion). In contrast, an event in the immediate present is more likely to be evaluated based on its intrinsic pleasantness (a concrete, sensual criterion). This suggests that the very "flavor" of an event's valence can change as it moves through time relative to the self.

### **Section 2: The Subjective Construction of Time**

Just as valence is not a simple, unitary property of a stimulus, time is not a fixed, objective reality that is passively perceived. From both psychological and philosophical perspectives, our experience of time is an active construction of the mind. Understanding the cognitive architecture that supports this construction—our capacity for "mental time travel," the nature of our temporal consciousness, and the conceptual metaphors we use to grasp the abstract nature of time—is essential for comprehending how valence can so profoundly shape our temporal world.

#### **2.1 Mental Time Travel and the Temporal Self**

A uniquely human capacity is the ability to engage in Mental Time Travel (MTT): the process of mentally projecting oneself into the past to re-experience events or into the future to pre-experience them.5 This remarkable faculty is the foundation of our subjective temporal world.

MTT gives rise to the concept of the **temporal self**, which encompasses our representations of our past self, present self, and future self.5 Psychologically, individuals strive to perceive these distinct selves as a continuous and unified whole, which forms the basis of a stable self-identity.5 However, despite this perceived unity, the mind represents these temporal selves in systematically different ways.

A substantial body of research indicates that remembering the past and imagining the future are not two wholly separate processes. They rely on a shared neural network and a common cognitive architecture.5 This overlap explains why individuals with amnesia who have difficulty recalling their personal past also struggle to imagine their personal future.6 Yet, crucial differences exist. Memory of the past, while reconstructive, is ultimately constrained by what actually occurred. In contrast, prospection—the act of thinking about the future—is more fluid and more deeply influenced by our current goals, motives, and imagination.5 It is less about recalling what was and more about simulating what could be.5

#### **2.2 The Philosophy of Temporal Consciousness**

The subjective experience of time has long been a central problem in philosophy. The core puzzle, often termed the paradox of temporal awareness, is this: How can we be directly aware of temporally extended phenomena like movement, change, and succession if, as it seems, our direct awareness is confined to a strictly momentary, durationless present?.9 If consciousness is just a series of instantaneous points, we should only ever perceive a static world. Yet, we plainly experience the flow of a melody or the motion of a passing car. Philosophers have proposed several models to resolve this paradox 9:

- **The Cinematic Model:** This model takes the momentary nature of consciousness as its starting point. It proposes that our stream of consciousness is composed of a rapid succession of discrete, static "snapshots," much like the individual frames of a film. On this view, we do not directly perceive motion or change; rather, we infer it from the sequence of these static mental states.
- **The Retentional Model:** Championed by phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, this model argues that while an episode of consciousness may itself be momentary, its content is complex and temporally structured. Each moment of awareness contains not only a "primal impression" of the present but also "retentions" of the immediate past. These retentions are not memories in the typical sense; they are a direct, fading presence of what has just been. This structure allows a momentary consciousness to represent a temporally extended event, thereby allowing for the direct experience of succession.
- **The Extensional Model:** This model offers the most intuitive solution, proposing that episodes of consciousness are not momentary but are themselves temporally extended. We are directly aware of change because our experience itself has duration, encompassing a brief interval of time.

Central to the retentional and extensional models is William James's concept of the **specious present**.9 James distinguished the mathematical, durationless "knife-edge" present from the experiential present, which he argued has a brief but tangible duration—a "saddle-back of time" with a certain breadth. This experienced "now" is what allows us to perceive the world not as a series of disconnected instants but as a continuous flow of events.

#### **2.3 The Metaphorical Scaffolding of Time**

Because time is an abstract concept, lacking any physical form that can be directly perceived, the human mind relies on more concrete domains to understand it. The most fundamental conceptual scaffold for time is space.10 We consistently use spatial language to talk about temporal relations: a meeting is moved "forward," we look "back" on our past, and a vacation seems like a "long" way off.

Within this overarching time-is-space metaphor, particularly along the front-back axis, two distinct perspectives of motion emerge 10:

1. **The Ego-Moving Perspective:** In this view, the self (or "ego") is conceptualized as moving forward along a static timeline toward the future. Statements like, "We are approaching the deadline," reflect this perspective.
2. **The Time-Moving Perspective:** Here, the self is static, and time is conceptualized as a moving entity (like a river or conveyor belt) that flows from the future, through the present, and into the past. This is reflected in statements like, "The deadline is approaching us."

The choice between these perspectives is not random; it can be systematically influenced by the emotional valence of future events. Research suggests that people are more likely to adopt an ego-moving perspective when anticipating a positive event, actively "moving toward" the desired outcome. Conversely, they may prefer a time-moving perspective for negative events, passively waiting for the unpleasant experience to arrive and pass by.10 This demonstrates a foundational link between valence and the very way we structure our conceptual motion through time.

The psychological data on the temporal self presents a profound challenge to traditional philosophical notions of a unified, continuous personal identity. While philosophers, particularly those following John Locke, have often grounded diachronic identity in psychological continuity—a stable, overlapping chain of memories, intentions, and character traits 12—psychology reveals that this continuity may be more of a biased, self-serving narrative than an objective fact. The finding that we systematically devalue our past selves to enhance the present, and treat distant temporal selves as if they were "other people," suggests that the links in the chain of psychological continuity are not stable and veridical.5 Instead, they appear to be actively edited, weakened, and re-framed to maintain a positive and coherent story about the self. This transforms the philosophical problem of identity. The question shifts from a metaphysical one—"What objectively makes me the same person over time?"—to a psychological and narrative one—"How do I actively construct and maintain a story in which I am the same person over time, and a person who is constantly improving?". Our sense of self is not a static entity that persists, but a dynamic story that is perpetually under revision.

## **Part II: Cognitive and Neural Mechanisms of Temporal Valence**

Having established the foundational concepts of valence and subjective time, this section delves into the cognitive and neural machinery that underpins their interaction. It moves from abstract theories to the concrete mechanisms by which our emotional state physically alters the texture of our temporal experience—warping our perception of duration, biasing the reconstruction of our past, and coloring our vision of the future. This exploration reveals that temporal valence is not merely a subjective feeling but a powerful force that shapes the fundamental processes of cognition.

### **Section 3: The Malleable Clock: How Valence Shapes Time Perception**

The common adages that "time flies when you're having fun" and "a watched pot never boils" point to a deep psychological truth: our experience of time's passage is not constant but is highly malleable, stretching and compressing in response to our internal state. Cognitive psychology has developed models to explain this subjective distortion of time, centering on the concepts of an "internal clock," arousal, and attention.

#### **3.1 The Internal Clock Model**

The dominant framework for explaining time perception is the internal clock model, a form of scalar expectancy theory (SET).22 This model posits a neural timekeeping mechanism composed of several key components 22:

1. A **pacemaker** that emits neural pulses at a certain rate.
2. A **switch** or **gate**, often linked to attention, that controls the flow of these pulses.
3. An **accumulator** that counts the pulses that pass through the gate.
4. A **memory system** (working and reference memory) that stores representations of previously experienced durations and compares them to the current count in the accumulator.

According to this model, our subjective judgment of an interval's duration is a function of how many pulses are counted by the accumulator. Any factor that alters the rate of the pacemaker or the operation of the switch will therefore distort our perception of time. Two such factors are paramount: arousal and attention.

- **Arousal:** Arousal, the level of physiological and psychological activation, is believed to directly modulate the speed of the pacemaker. Higher arousal—whether from positive stimuli like excitement or negative stimuli like fear—is thought to increase the rate of pulse emission.22 With the clock running faster, more pulses are accumulated in a given objective interval, leading to an
  *overestimation* of duration. This is the mechanism often cited to explain why time seems to slow down in a moment of crisis.22
- **Attention:** Attention is conceptualized as the switch that allows pulses to reach the accumulator. When attention is directed toward the passage of time itself, the switch remains open, and pulses are faithfully counted, potentially leading to an overestimation of duration. When attention is diverted away from time and onto other aspects of a task or experience, the switch may close intermittently, causing pulses to be missed.22 This results in a lower pulse count and an
  *underestimation* of duration—the classic "time flies" effect.25

#### **3.2 The Modulating Role of Valence**

While arousal and attention are the primary drivers of the internal clock, emotional valence (positive vs. negative) plays a significant, albeit more complex, modulatory role. A meta-analysis of numerous studies concluded that, on the whole, negative valence tends to produce a greater overestimation of time compared to positive valence.26 This aligns with the common experience that "in sorrow, days seem years".27

However, the effect of valence is rarely straightforward and often interacts with arousal levels. For example, one influential study found that for low-arousal stimuli, positive images were judged as lasting longer than negative ones, but for high-arousal stimuli, this pattern reversed, with negative images being judged as longer.23 This suggests that valence does not simply add or subtract from the clock's speed but engages in a more dynamic interplay with the level of physiological activation.

These distortions have significant clinical relevance. Individuals with anxiety disorders or depression often exhibit a bias toward negative stimuli and maintain a state of heightened arousal.22 According to the internal clock model, this combination should lead to a chronic perception of time passing more slowly. This subjective temporal dragging can, in turn, exacerbate the symptoms of the disorder, creating a vicious cycle where the feeling of being trapped in a slow-moving, threatening present reinforces the underlying anxiety or depressive rumination.22

The apparent inconsistencies in the literature regarding valence's effect on time perception—where negative emotions sometimes slow time and sometimes do not—can be elegantly resolved by introducing a more fundamental dimension of emotion: motivational direction. Rather than asking whether an emotion is simply positive or negative, a more predictive question is whether it promotes *approach* (the urge to move toward a stimulus) or *withdrawal* (the urge to move away). This reframes the question from one of pure feeling to one of functional action tendency.

Consider anger, a negatively valenced emotion that is typically approach-motivated; it prepares the organism to confront a threat or obstacle. Conversely, disgust is a negatively valenced emotion that is withdrawal-motivated, preparing the organism to avoid contamination. Research that disentangles valence from motivation reveals a clear pattern: approach-motivated states, regardless of their valence, tend to *hasten* the perception of time.29 This includes positive states like desire and negative states like anger. This may be an adaptive mechanism for goal pursuit, as a narrowed focus on the goal makes the intervening time seem to pass more quickly. In contrast, withdrawal-motivated states, such as disgust and fear, reliably

*slow* the perception of time.29 This, too, is adaptive, as it increases vigilance and allows more processing time in the presence of a potential threat. This motivational framework provides a more coherent explanation for our subjective temporal experiences. It accounts for why "time flies" not only "when you're having fun" (a positive, approach-motivated state) but also during a heated, goal-directed argument (a negative, approach-motivated state). The speed of our internal clock is not just a byproduct of raw arousal; it is a sophisticated mechanism tuned to our fundamental motivational goals.

### **Section 4: The Past Reimagined: Memory Biases and Temporal Valence**

Our relationship with the past is not one of passive retrieval from a static archive. Memory is a profoundly reconstructive process, constantly being reshaped and reinterpreted through the lens of our present goals, beliefs, and emotional states. Emotional valence is one of the most powerful forces shaping this reconstruction, leading to a number of systematic biases that color our view of what has been. These biases do not operate in a single direction; instead, they reveal a complex cognitive architecture that simultaneously works to sanitize the past of its negativity while also preserving the detailed imprint of threatening events.

#### **4.1 Positivity Biases in Memory: Rosy Retrospection and the Fading Affect Bias**

A dominant theme in the study of autobiographical memory is a pervasive bias toward the positive. The mind appears to possess mechanisms that systematically curate our life story, emphasizing positive experiences and diminishing the emotional sting of negative ones over time.

- **Rosy Retrospection:** This is the common tendency to recall and evaluate past events more positively than they were experienced at the time.30 We remember the "good old days" through "rose-tinted glasses," often lamenting that the present does not measure up.33 This bias can distort our evaluations of progress over time and may serve as a coping mechanism, allowing us to draw on idealized past memories to regulate negative emotions in the present.33
- **Fading Affect Bias (FAB):** This is a related but more specific mechanism that contributes to the overall positivity of our memory store. Research has shown that the emotional intensity associated with negative autobiographical memories tends to fade more rapidly over time than the emotional intensity associated with positive memories.34 The result is a net increase in the positivity of one's personal past as time passes.
- **Nostalgia:** This complex, often bittersweet emotion is deeply intertwined with these positivity biases.32 Nostalgia is a sentimental longing for the past, and while it can be a source of comfort and meaning, its emotional texture is not simple.34 Recent research indicates that nostalgic memories, while initially highly positive, can become more emotionally complex over time. As the initial positive affect fades slightly, negative emotions like regret and loneliness can intensify, creating the characteristic bittersweet quality of the experience.37 Despite this complexity, nostalgic memories are still, on balance, more positive than ordinary memories and serve important psychological functions, including boosting self-esteem and social connection.37

#### **4.2 Negativity Biases and Valence-Specific Neural Encoding**

Despite the powerful drive toward positivity, the cognitive system also possesses mechanisms that prioritize the processing and retention of negative, and particularly threatening, information. This reflects an evolutionary imperative: while remembering positive events is good for well-being, failing to remember a threat can be fatal.

The **Emotion-Enhanced Memory (EEM)** effect describes the general finding that emotionally significant events, both positive and negative, are remembered more accurately and vividly than neutral events.38 However, cognitive neuroscience research reveals that this enhancement is not achieved through a single, unified mechanism. Instead, positive and negative information appear to be encoded and consolidated via distinct neural pathways, resulting in memories with different qualitative characteristics.38

- **Negative and High-Arousal Memory:** The encoding of negative and/or high-arousal information is strongly associated with heightened activity in the **amygdala** and in sensory processing regions of the brain, particularly the **occipital and temporal lobes**.38 The amygdala is thought to modulate memory consolidation processes in these sensory regions, effectively "tagging" the information as important. This leads to memories for negative events that are particularly rich in perceptual detail and vividness.41 This sensory focus can also alter the perceived temporal structure of memory; for example, a sequence of negative events may be remembered as having occurred closer together in time than they actually did, a phenomenon known as temporal compression.42
- **Positive and Low-Arousal Memory:** In contrast, subsequent memory for positive and/or low-arousal information is more strongly associated with activity in the **prefrontal cortex**.38 These frontal regions are linked to more elaborative, conceptual, and semantic processing. This suggests that positive events are often encoded in a more schematic or gist-based manner, focusing on their meaning and relation to other knowledge rather than on their raw perceptual details.38

#### **4.3 The Positivity Effect in Aging**

The interplay between these valence-specific systems appears to change across the lifespan. A well-documented phenomenon known as the **positivity effect** describes the tendency for older adults, relative to younger adults, to show a preferential bias in attention and memory for positive over negative information.40

This shift is not believed to be an automatic or inevitable consequence of aging. Rather, it appears to be a form of goal-directed emotion regulation that is dependent on cognitive control resources.45 Studies have shown that the positivity effect is most pronounced in older adults with high levels of executive function. Those with lower cognitive control abilities may not show the effect, and their memory patterns may more closely resemble those of younger adults, who often exhibit a negativity bias (i.e., better memory for negative than positive information).45 This suggests that the positivity effect in aging is an active cognitive process, whereby older individuals leverage their cognitive resources to curate their mental experience, focusing on information that enhances well-being.

The existence of both strong positivity biases (like rosy retrospection) and a robust, implicit preference for the future over the past (the "positive-future effect") presents an apparent contradiction. How can we simultaneously idealize the past and evaluate the future as being better? This tension can be resolved by recognizing that these biases may operate at different levels of cognition, revealed by the different methodologies used to study them. Rosy retrospection and nostalgia are typically studied through explicit self-report and conscious recall, which are slow, deliberate, narrative-based processes.32 These processes reflect the work of a conscious, story-telling self, actively constructing a coherent and flattering life narrative. In contrast, the positive-future effect is most reliably demonstrated using chronometric methods like the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which bypass conscious deliberation to measure fast, automatic, and unconscious associations.35 This suggests a dissociation between two cognitive systems. Our slower, more deliberate narrative system (akin to Kahneman's System 2) works to craft a positive story of our past to maintain self-esteem and a sense of meaning. Simultaneously, our faster, automatic, and intuitive system (System 1) harbors a default optimistic orientation toward the future, an adaptive stance that promotes motivation and forward-looking action. These two biases are not mutually exclusive; they simply reflect the different priorities of different levels of the mind.

### **Section 5: The Future Envisioned: Prospection, Forecasting, and Construal**

Our capacity to think about the future is a cornerstone of human intelligence, enabling planning, goal-setting, and the regulation of behavior over time. However, this faculty of prospection is not a perfectly rational or objective tool. Our mental construction of the future is subject to a set of powerful and systematic biases that are deeply rooted in the cognitive mechanisms we use to traverse psychological distance. Understanding these mechanisms—how we construe distant events, how we forecast our future feelings, and our innate optimistic tendencies—is key to understanding the valence of the future.

#### **5.1 Construal Level Theory (CLT)**

Construal Level Theory (CLT) provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how we think about things that are not part of our immediate experience.15 The theory's central principle is that psychological distance changes the nature of our mental representations. Psychological distance is an egocentric concept that includes not only temporal distance (time) but also spatial distance, social distance (other people), and hypotheticality (likelihood).14

According to CLT, as psychological distance increases, our mental construals of objects and events become more abstract, schematic, and decontextualized. This is known as **high-level construal**. Conversely, as psychological distance decreases, our construals become more concrete, detailed, and contextualized—a **low-level construal**.14

This principle has profound implications for temporal thought. An event in the distant future (e.g., a professional conference next year) is represented at a high level, focusing on its core, essential features and its ultimate purpose (the *why*): "advancing my career," "networking".15 An event in the near future (the same conference next week) is represented at a low level, focusing on concrete, peripheral details and the specific actions required to implement it (the

*how*): "printing my poster," "packing my suitcase," "booking a taxi to the airport".49

This shift in construal level directly impacts our evaluations and preferences. When an event is temporally distant and construed abstractly, we tend to weigh its **desirability** (high-level features related to its value and end-state) more heavily. When the same event is near and construed concretely, we give more weight to its **feasibility** (low-level features related to the practicalities and difficulties of achieving it).49 This explains why a challenging but ultimately rewarding goal, like running a marathon, can seem highly appealing when planned months in advance (focus on the desirable outcome) but daunting the week before (focus on the feasible, and painful, process).

#### **5.2 Affective Forecasting: Predicting Future Feelings**

Affective forecasting is the process of predicting our future emotional states.16 These predictions can be broken down into four components: forecasts about the

**valence** of our feelings (will this event make me feel good or bad?), the **specific emotions** we will experience (e.g., joy, anger, sadness), the **intensity** of those emotions, and their **duration**.16

While people are generally accurate in predicting the valence of their emotional reactions—we correctly anticipate that getting a promotion will feel better than being laid off—we are prone to significant and systematic errors in predicting the intensity and duration of these feelings.17 The most well-documented of these errors is the

**impact bias**: the tendency to overestimate the enduring impact that future events will have on our emotional lives.17 We often believe that positive events will make us happier, and for longer, than they actually do, and that negative events will be more devastating, and for longer, than they turn out to be. For example, sports fans consistently overestimate how happy they will be in the days following a victory by their favorite team.17

#### **5.3 The Optimism Bias and the Positive-Future Effect**

Our vision of the future is also colored by a powerful and pervasive cognitive bias toward optimism. The **optimism bias** is the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of experiencing positive events and to underestimate the likelihood of experiencing negative events, relative to our peers.50 Most people believe they are less likely than others to get divorced, be in a car accident, or suffer a serious illness.53 This bias, while potentially leading to poor risk assessment, is thought to be adaptive, as it reduces anxiety and motivates goal pursuit.52

Related to this is the **positive-future effect**, a robust finding from both explicit and implicit measures that people generally evaluate the future more positively than the past.8 When asked to reflect, people rate future events as more emotionally positive than past events.8 This optimistic orientation toward the future appears to be a default setting of the human cognitive system and is associated with specific neural patterns, such as reduced sensitivity in the anterior cingulate cortex to negative information about the future.35

The principles of Construal Level Theory offer a powerful, unifying mechanism that can help explain the cognitive origins of both the impact bias and the optimism bias. These are not necessarily separate phenomena but may be downstream consequences of the fundamental way our minds process temporal distance. When we engage in affective forecasting for a distant future event, CLT dictates that we will construe it abstractly.14 This abstract focus causes us to zero in on the central, defining features of the event (e.g., "losing my job") while systematically neglecting the myriad other concrete, peripheral life events that will inevitably occur at the same time and will serve to buffer and regulate our emotional state (e.g., spending time with family, engaging in hobbies, finding new opportunities). This process of "focalism," driven by high-level construal, naturally leads to an overestimation of the event's isolated emotional impact—the impact bias. Similarly, abstract construal simplifies our view of the future, stripping events of their messy, concrete complexities. When we think about "getting married" in the distant future, we focus on the abstract, desirable "gist" of the event (e.g., "lifelong companionship") rather than the concrete, and often less desirable, details (e.g., "arguing about finances," "dealing with in-laws"). This tendency to represent the distant future in terms of its simplified, abstract, and often most desirable features directly contributes to an overly simplistic and optimistic forecast of what is to come.16 Thus, the very act of looking into the temporal distance forces our mind into an abstract mode, which in turn produces these well-documented forecasting errors as a natural consequence.

## **Part III: Philosophical Inquiries into Identity, Ethics, and Experience**

The psychological mechanisms that shape our experience of temporal valence do not operate in a vacuum. They have profound implications for some of the most enduring questions in philosophy, particularly those concerning the nature of the self, the foundations of morality, and the structure of conscious experience. By using the empirical findings from psychology as a lens, this section re-examines these philosophical problems, revealing how our biased and constructive relationship with time challenges long-standing assumptions about personal identity and ethical reasoning.

### **Section 6: The Self Across Time: Personal Identity and Temporal Appraisals**

The question of what makes an individual the same person over time is a central problem in metaphysics. As we undergo constant physical and psychological change, what grounds our persistent identity? This philosophical inquiry, however, often proceeds with an idealized conception of the self's relationship to its past and future. Psychological research on how we actually appraise our temporal selves reveals a more complex and biased reality, one that fundamentally challenges the premises of traditional philosophical theories.

#### **6.1 The Philosophical Problem of Diachronic Identity**

The philosophical problem of diachronic identity, or identity over time, seeks to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a person existing at one time to be the same person as a person existing at another time.12 Two major families of theories have dominated this debate:

- **The Bodily Criterion:** This view holds that personal identity consists in the persistence of the same physical body or, more specifically, the same biological organism. A person persists through time just in case they are the same human animal.54
- **The Psychological Criterion:** Originating with John Locke, this view argues that personal identity is grounded not in the body but in consciousness and psychological continuity.12 On this account, a person at time t2 is the same as a person at time t1 if there exists an overlapping chain of strong psychological connections between them. These connections include memories, intentions, beliefs, desires, and character traits.12 Locke famously argued that the concept of a person is a "forensic concept," meaning its primary importance is for the attribution of moral responsibility. We hold someone accountable for a past action only if they are the same
  *person* who performed it, which for Locke meant being connected by consciousness.13

#### **6.2 The Psychological Reality of the "Fragmented" Self**

While philosophical theories often assume that the psychological connections linking our temporal selves are stable and veridical, psychological research paints a very different picture. Our relationship with our past and future selves is not one of neutral observation but of active and biased appraisal, driven by the motivation to maintain a positive view of the present self.

**Temporal Self-Appraisal Theory**, proposed by Wilson and Ross, posits that individuals are motivated to enhance their current self-view. A key strategy for achieving this is to engage in biased temporal comparisons: we tend to derogate our distant past selves while viewing our future selves with unrealistic optimism.5 This creates the flattering illusion of constant personal improvement.

- **The Past Self as "Other":** We psychologically distance ourselves from our past imperfections. Studies show that people often adopt a third-person, "observer" perspective when recalling distant past events, especially those that are inconsistent with their current self-concept.6 This distancing is amplified by
  **temporal landmarks**, such as New Year's Day, birthdays, or the start of a new week.56 These landmarks function as psychological "new beginnings," creating a clean break that allows us to dissociate from our past failures and embrace a new, untarnished self. This is often referred to as the "fresh start effect".56
- **The Future Self as "Better":** There is a robust and consistent positivity bias toward the future self. People believe they are getting better over time, and they evaluate their future selves more positively than their present or past selves.7 This optimistic prospection is a powerful motivator, but it also reflects a degree of psychological distance from a future self that is often idealized.

These psychological findings fundamentally destabilize the foundations of the Psychological Criterion of identity. The very "psychological connections" that philosophers like Locke and Parfit rely on to ground personal identity—our memories and intentions—are shown by psychology to be not objective, veridical links, but biased, self-serving narrative threads. The philosophical premise is that identity is preserved through a real continuity of consciousness. The psychological reality is that we actively create a *motivated discontinuity*, pushing away our flawed past self to make our present self look better. If the memories that are supposed to guarantee my identity over time are being systematically distorted to serve my present-moment need for self-esteem, then the notion of a stable, continuous psychological self becomes a useful fiction rather than a metaphysical fact.

This suggests a radical reframing of the problem of personal identity. It may be more fruitful to understand identity not as a metaphysical state to be discovered, but as a *narrative project* to be continuously maintained. The goal of this project is not to preserve an objective connection to a past entity, but to construct a coherent and flattering story in which the protagonist—the present self—is always on an upward trajectory. This aligns with concepts like "temporal bandwidth," which suggests that a rich and resilient sense of self is built not on a simple chain of memories, but on the integration of a deep and layered narrative of the past into the present moment.57

### **Section 7: The Moral Weight of Time: Future Bias and Intergenerational Ethics**

Our asymmetric valuation of time—the way we feel differently about events depending on whether they are in the past or future—is not just a psychological curiosity. It has profound ethical implications, shaping our personal decisions about suffering and pleasure and, on a larger scale, influencing our collective moral responsibility to future generations.

#### **7.1 The "Future Bias": Why Tomorrow's Pain Hurts More**

Most people exhibit a strong and intuitive **future bias**: we prefer negative experiences to be in the past and positive experiences to be in the future.21 This preference is powerfully illustrated by a thought experiment from the philosopher Derek Parfit: imagine you are in a hospital and are told you either endured an extremely painful 10-hour operation yesterday (of which you have no memory) or you will undergo a painful but much shorter 1-hour operation tomorrow. The vast majority of people would choose to have the longer, more painful experience be in the past.21

This bias, while psychologically compelling, leads to ethically troubling conclusions. It means that we are willing to choose a world that contains a greater total amount of suffering, provided that the excess suffering is located in the past.21 From a standpoint of impartial rationality, this seems indefensible. The suffering was no less real for the person who experienced it yesterday. The common rationalizations for this preference—"what's done is done," or that the past is causally inaccessible—reflect our standard conception of a self that moves forward in time, leaving the "past me" behind as a distinct and no-longer-existing entity.21

#### **7.2 A Philosophical Counterargument: The Reductionist View**

An alternative philosophical perspective, often associated with reductionist theories of personal identity, challenges the ethical legitimacy of the future bias. This view, also advanced by Parfit, suggests that a "person" is not a single, enduring entity but is better understood as a series of distinct "consciousness-moments" or "person-stages" that are causally related.21

From this perspective, what is intrinsically bad about suffering is the negative quality of the experience *at the moment it occurs*. The moral badness of pain exists for the unique consciousness-moment that is experiencing it, regardless of that moment's temporal location relative to our present vantage point.21 The pain of the person in the hospital yesterday was just as real and just as bad

*for them, then*, as the pain of the person tomorrow will be *for them, then*. Therefore, an impartial moral calculus should be time-neutral, aiming to minimize the total number of suffering consciousness-moments across all of time. To prefer more past suffering over less future suffering is to condemn a past consciousness-moment to needless pain simply because it is not "us" now.

#### **7.3 From Personal Bias to Public Policy: Intergenerational Ethics**

The ethical dilemmas raised by the future bias at the individual level are magnified to a global scale in the domain of **intergenerational ethics**. This field grapples with the moral obligations of the present generation to future generations, particularly concerning long-term problems like climate change, nuclear waste disposal, and resource depletion.59

Intergenerational relations are characterized by a profound **asymmetry of power**: the actions of the present generation can have massive and irreversible consequences for people in the future, while future generations can do nothing to affect us.59 This challenges ethical theories based on reciprocity or mutual advantage.

A further complication is the **nonidentity problem**. Many policies enacted today (e.g., a major energy policy) will affect not only the quality of life for future people but also *which specific people come to exist*. This makes it philosophically difficult to argue that a specific future person is "harmed" by our actions, because if we had acted differently, that person would not have existed at all; a different person would have existed in their place.59

Our individual future bias can be seen as a psychological microcosm of the societal challenge of intergenerational ethics. The same intuition that leads us to discount the suffering of our own past self may make it psychologically difficult to grant full moral weight to the well-being of distant, future selves who we will never meet.

The strong psychological intuition of future bias, while perhaps evolutionarily adaptive for an individual agent focused on immediate threats and opportunities, becomes ethically perilous when scaled to the level of a global civilization with long-term technological power. The psychological heuristic that helps an individual prioritize their upcoming week—focus on the future you can change and don't worry about the past you cannot 21—becomes a profound moral blind spot when a society must prioritize the well-being of the next millennium. Our innate temporal preferences are poorly calibrated for the scale of our current impact on the planet.59 This suggests that addressing long-term collective action problems like climate change requires more than just technological and economic solutions. It demands cognitive and ethical frameworks that help us consciously override our intuitive but dangerously myopic temporal biases. This reframes intergenerational ethics as, in part, a problem of applied cognitive psychology: how can we cultivate a sense of moral responsibility for a future that our evolved psychology is not naturally equipped to value?

## **Part IV: Behavioral Manifestations and Applied Implications**

The intricate relationship between time and valence is not confined to the realms of cognitive theory and philosophical debate. It manifests directly and powerfully in our everyday behavior, driving our motivation, shaping our pursuit of goals, and underlying common failures of self-regulation like procrastination. Understanding these behavioral consequences allows for the development of practical applications and interventions across diverse fields, from clinical psychology and marketing to public policy.

### **Section 8: The Engine of Action: Motivation, Goal Pursuit, and Temporal Valence**

Our valenced representations of the future are the primary fuel for goal-directed action in the present. Motivation is the psychological driving force that enables us to move from a current state to a desired future state, and this force is exquisitely sensitive to the temporal and affective qualities of our goals.60

#### **8.1 Valence, Motivation, and Goal Activation**

The valence of a goal and the affective state of the individual are critical determinants of motivational strength.

- **The Role of Positive Affect:** A large body of research demonstrates that positive affective states generally facilitate the adoption and pursuit of goals.61 When goals are mentally linked with positive stimuli, they are pursued with greater vigor and persistence.61
- **Motivational Intensity vs. Valence:** However, not all positive states are equally motivating. A crucial distinction must be made between valence and **motivational intensity**. High-intensity positive affects, such as desire, excitement, and determination, are typically experienced *pre-goal* and serve as preparatory states that energize action. In contrast, low-intensity positive affects, such as serenity, contentment, and amusement, are often experienced *post-goal* or in response to goal-irrelevant stimuli and are less conducive to active pursuit.61
- **The Complex Valence of Effort:** The relationship between effort and valence is not linear. On one hand, the "law of least effort" suggests that organisms are biased to avoid situations associated with unnecessary effort, and that such situations can generate a negative valence.62 We dislike the slow computer or the shopping cart with a bad wheel. On the other hand, a wealth of research on motivational intensity shows that difficult (but not impossibly difficult) goal pursuit can enhance the desirability of the goal's end-state, generating positive valence.62 The act of successfully overcoming a challenge imbues the goal with greater value.

#### **8.2 The Role of Feedback**

As we pursue goals, we constantly receive feedback about our performance. The motivational impact of this feedback—whether it spurs us on or causes us to give up—depends critically on how its valence (positive or negative) is interpreted in the context of our temporal progress.

- **Positive Feedback:** Receiving positive feedback (e.g., praise, a good grade) can have two opposing effects. It is motivating when it is interpreted as a signal of increased **commitment** to the goal ("This success proves I am the kind of person who can do this"). However, it can be demotivating if it is interpreted as a signal that **sufficient progress** has been made, leading to "coasting" or a premature reduction in effort ("I've done enough for now, I can relax").63
- **Negative Feedback:** Similarly, negative feedback (e.g., criticism, a poor result) is motivating when it signals **insufficient progress** toward a valued and achievable goal, spurring greater effort to close the gap ("I need to work harder"). It becomes demotivating if it is interpreted as a signal of a lack of ability or a reason to decrease **commitment** ("This is too hard for me; it's not worth it").63

#### **8.3 Temporal Landmarks as Motivational Catalysts**

Initiating goal pursuit is often one of the most difficult steps. The "fresh start effect" describes how **temporal landmarks**—such as the first day of the week, month, or year, or a personal birthday—can serve as powerful catalysts for goal initiation.56

The mechanism behind this effect is narrative and psychological. These landmarks create a sense of a new beginning, a new "mental account" that is psychologically dissociated from the "old self" and its history of failures and imperfections.56 By creating this temporal discontinuity, the landmark allows an individual to shed the baggage of past failures and adopt a more positive and efficacious view of their current self's ability to succeed, thereby increasing motivation to act on self-improvement goals.56

Successful motivation, therefore, is not simply a matter of having a highly valued goal. It is a dynamic process of managing the temporal-valence narrative we tell ourselves about that goal. This narrative management begins with initiation, where we can leverage temporal landmarks to create a "chapter break" in our life story, providing a clean slate and a renewed sense of agency.56 As we proceed, we must interpret the feedback we receive as plot points. A success can be framed as evidence of our protagonist's deep commitment, driving the story forward, or as a minor resolution that allows for a pause in the action. A setback can be framed as a challenge that strengthens our hero's resolve or as a sign that the quest is futile.63 Effective self-regulation involves becoming a skilled author of one's own motivational story, constantly framing events in a way that sustains commitment and directs action toward the desired final act.

### **Section 9: The Delaying Self: Procrastination and Temporal Discounting**

Procrastination is a quintessential failure of temporal motivation. It represents a victory of the present self's desire for immediate mood repair over the future self's need for long-term goal achievement. Understanding procrastination through the lens of temporal valence reveals that it is not primarily a problem of poor time management, but a deeper issue rooted in emotion regulation and a psychological disconnect from our own future.

#### **9.1 Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT)**

Temporal Motivation Theory (TMT) provides a formal economic and psychological model for understanding procrastination.18 A simplified version of its core equation is:

Motivation=1+(Impulsiveness×Delay)Expectancy×Value

This equation elegantly captures the key factors at play. Motivation to pursue a task is high when we expect to succeed (high expectancy) and when the outcome is highly rewarding (high value). Motivation is undermined by two key temporal factors: the delay until the reward is received, and an individual's personal sensitivity to that delay (impulsiveness).18

The core mechanism driving the effect of delay is **temporal discounting** (or hyperbolic discounting). This is the robust finding that the subjective value of a reward decreases as the delay to its receipt increases, and it does so in a characteristically steep, hyperbolic curve.19 A reward tomorrow is worth much more to us than a reward in a year, but the difference between a reward in a year and a reward in a year and a day is negligible. Chronic procrastinators consistently exhibit steeper temporal discounting curves; the value of future rewards evaporates much more quickly for them, making it difficult to motivate action for distant goals.19

#### **9.2 The Psychology of Procrastination**

While TMT provides a powerful formal model, a deeper psychological understanding reveals that procrastination is fundamentally an **emotion regulation problem**.67 We procrastinate on tasks not because we are lazy or bad at planning, but because the task itself elicits negative emotions in the present moment—boredom, anxiety, frustration, self-doubt, or resentment. Procrastination is an avoidance strategy: we put the task off to escape these aversive feelings, choosing the short-term reward of immediate mood repair at the expense of our long-term goals.67

This emotional calculus is made possible by a psychological **disconnect from the future self**. As established in Part III, we often perceive our future self as a different person, a stranger.7 This psychological distance makes it easier to offload our current burdens onto them. The negative consequences of our delay—the stress, the panic, the poor-quality work—will be borne by this future "stranger," while the benefit of avoiding negative feelings is enjoyed by "us" right now.

The concepts of emotion regulation and the disconnected future self can be synthesized into a single, more powerful explanation: procrastination is a failure of *affective empathy* for the future self. Empathy is the capacity to understand and share the feelings of another. If our future self is psychologically constructed as an "other," then acting in our long-term interest requires us to feel a degree of empathy for that future person's well-being. Procrastination arises when this empathetic connection breaks down. The suffering of our future self becomes an abstract, semantic problem ("I know they will be stressed"), while our own present-moment discomfort is a visceral, affective reality ("I feel anxious right now"). In this conflict between the affective and the semantic, the immediate affective concern for the present self wins out. This reframes the challenge of overcoming procrastination. It is not just about managing time or breaking down tasks; it is about cultivating a stronger psychological and empathetic connection to the person we are to become. Interventions that foster this connection—such as vividly imagining the future self's emotional state or writing a letter to one's future self—may be powerful tools for bridging this temporal-empathetic divide.

### **Section 10: Applications and Interventions**

The insights gleaned from the psychological and philosophical study of temporal valence have significant practical relevance. By understanding how the valenced perception of time shapes cognition, emotion, and behavior, we can develop more effective interventions and strategies in domains ranging from mental health to marketing and public policy. A common thread running through these applications is the idea of reshaping an individual's relationship with their own temporal selves.

#### **10.1 Clinical Psychology**

Distortions in temporal valence are a core feature of several mental health conditions, making this a critical area for clinical intervention.

- **Anxiety and Depression:** Individuals with anxiety disorders often perceive threatening situations as lasting longer than they actually do, amplifying their distress.28 Depressed individuals frequently exhibit a breakdown of the typical "positive-future effect"; they are often trapped in ruminative cycles about a negatively valenced past while viewing the future as hopeless and bleak.22 Therapeutic approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be understood as interventions that directly target these temporal-valence biases, helping patients to re-appraise the valence of past events and to construct a more balanced and hopeful representation of the future.
- **Distinguishing Affective and Semantic Valence:** The distinction between feeling bad (affective valence) and knowing something is bad (semantic valence) is crucial for clinical assessment and treatment.68 A patient's self-report of "feeling bad" can be ambiguous. Understanding the underlying neural and cognitive differences between these two modes of valence can lead to more precise diagnoses. For instance, a patient might be suffering from an overactive affective response system, or from a rigid, negative semantic belief system, and each would require a different therapeutic focus.

#### **10.2 Marketing and Public Policy**

The principles of temporal valence are powerful tools for persuasion and behavior change, used both in commercial and pro-social contexts.

- **Marketing and Advertising:** The effectiveness of persuasive messages is highly dependent on the strategic manipulation of temporal valence. Research on charitable advertising shows a complex interplay between message framing (gain vs. loss), image valence (positive vs. negative), and temporal framing (short-term vs. long-term statistics).69 For example, a negatively framed message paired with a negative image is most effective when the problem is framed in a short-term, concrete manner (e.g., "Every hour, 1,250 children die from poverty"). Conversely, a positive message and image are more effective when the scale is framed in the long term (e.g., "Help 11 million children this year").69 This demonstrates that successful persuasion requires a sophisticated alignment of valence across multiple temporal and conceptual dimensions.
- **Public Health and Political Campaigns:** Public policy campaigns aimed at promoting health (e.g., smoking cessation) or political action must also contend with temporal valence. The valence of a message can influence everything from memory and persuasion to intentions for political participation.70 For instance, negatively valenced messages may be more persuasive in some contexts, while messages that evoke high-arousal emotions can be more effective at driving immediate action.70 Similarly, in political campaigns, voters' valenced assessments of a candidate's competence on specific issues are often more influential in changing votes than abstract ideological alignment.71

Across these diverse applied domains, a unifying theme emerges: effective intervention often involves reshaping an individual's relationship with their own temporal selves. In clinical psychology, therapy aims to help patients re-narrate their relationship with a painful past and build a more hopeful connection to their future self. In marketing, effective advertising often succeeds by linking a product to a consumer's idealized future self. In public policy, encouraging long-term pro-social behaviors, from saving for retirement to taking action on climate change, fundamentally requires strengthening individuals' sense of connection and responsibility to their own future self and to the selves of future generations. The abstract concepts of the temporal self and temporal valence are, therefore, not merely academic curiosities. They represent a fundamental lever for understanding and influencing human behavior. Interventions that can successfully alter how a person perceives, values, and connects with their past and future selves are likely to be the most powerful and enduring agents of change.
