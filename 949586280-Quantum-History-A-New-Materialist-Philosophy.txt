 Introduction: Materialism
   and quantum criticism


Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, a satirical novella by Edwin Abbott
published in 1884, uses the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to
comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture. The narrator “Square,” who
guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions,
dreams of a visit to a one-dimensional world, “Lineland,” inhabited by men
consisting of lines; he is then visited by a Sphere, but is unable to see the three-
dimensional object as anything other than a circle (more precisely, a disk).
After the Square’s mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the
Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth dimension and
higher spatial dimensions. The Square then has a dream in which the Sphere
introduces him to a zero-dimensional space, Pointland, of whom the Point
(sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication
as a thought originating in his own mind . . .
   After its publication the book was half-forgotten; it was discovered again
after Einstein’s general theory of relativity brought to prominence the concept
of a fourth dimension.1 Recent trends in quantum mechanics—specifically,
the holographic principle—rendered Flatland even more prophetic while
inverting the entire perspective. If the three-dimensional reality available to
our senses can be thought of as a hologram, an image of reality generated by
an unimaginably distant two-dimensional boundary, the problem is no longer
to explain additional dimensions outside of our standard reality but, on the
contrary, to grasp how

                                                                                  1
2                                  Quantum History


    everything there is to know about strings and gravity in a four-dimensional
    anti-de-Sutter universe can be encrypted in quantum interactions of ordinary
    particles and fields lying entirely in the three-dimensional boundary surface.
    The surface world would function as a kind of hologram . . . It is almost as if
    you could learn everything about the interior of an orange by meticulously
    analyzing its skin.2


The latest developments move us even further towards Pointland: “The
complete notion of a point of space-time in fact consists of the appearance of
the entire universe as seen from that point.”3
    How can we account for these paradoxes in the terms of materialism?
Lenin wrote his Materialism and Empiriocriticism as a materialist reply to
attempts by obscurantist philosophers to give a spiritualist twist to new scientific
discoveries—discoveries which seemed to undermine materialism, or at least
contain the potential to do so.4 Today, a little bit more than a century later, we are
witnessing similar attempts to give a spiritualist spin to quantum mechanics.
The fact that entangled particles can influence each other faster than the speed
of light is taken as proof that there is a spiritual domain of instant communication
outside material reality; the fact that a wave function collapses into reality
through observation is interpreted as a proof that observation creates reality . . .
no wonder many podcasts claim that quantum mechanics proves material
reality is a simulacrum, that all there is, is spirit, etc.5 Such views have proliferated
recently, after the set of orthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics known
as the “Copenhagen interpretation” which dominated traditional teachings for
much of the twentieth century were largely abandoned. In the absence of these
consensus principles, questions about the ontological status of quantum
phenomena exploded. While fully endorsing the results of quantum mechanics,
the present book follows Lenin’s insight that, with each big scientific discovery,
the notion of materialism should be radically rethought.
    This is not to say that Materialism and Empiriocriticism is a perfect book, or
a model to slavishly follow. I have no problem with critiques such as those of
Carlo Rovelli, who devotes a whole chapter of his Helgoland to defending
Bogdanov against Lenin’s scathing critique.6 Materialism and Empiriocriticism
                                    Introduction                                   3


is in its content a very primitive and dogmatic book; its notion of matter is
simultaneously too general (if matter is defined as objects which exist in the
world independently of subjective perception, then Plato is definitely a
materialist . . .) and too narrow (as if the basic claim of materialism is that
“matter” is some tiny elementary particles moving in space and time). The
basic failure of Materialism and Empiriocriticism is that Lenin completely
misses the transcendental dimension, reducing it to the pre-transcendental
solipsist empiricism of Berkeley (reality only exists in my mind).7 So my aim is
to repeat Lenin’s gesture by way of transforming it radically, evolving it to the
level of considering materialism without matter, of a level of reality outside our
confines of space and time.
   Hegel’s formula of reconciliation—subject should recognize itself in its
other—solicits three readings: subjective-idealist (I recognize reality as my
own product), vulgar-materialist naturalism (I recognize that I am just a small
part of objective reality, a result of the evolution of life on earth), and a proper
dialectical-materialist (I recognize myself, my place, in the lack in the Other, at
the point at which the Other fails, at the point of impossibility in the Other). In
the third reading, alienation is not left behind, it is just redoubled: my alienation
from the Other is simultaneously the alienation of the Other from itself.
   In one of his well-known jokes, Ronald Reagan proposes to refute atheism
with the following scenario: he will invite a group of distinguished atheists to
an exquisite dinner cooked by the very best chefs, and after the dinner he will
just ask them: “Do you believe there is a cook who created this meal?” In an
obvious analogy, many much more perfect things in our universe prove that
there also has to be a supreme “cook”-creator . . . The non-sequitur of this joke
is rather obvious,8 and I consider the following joke about belief in god a much
better one. An atheist has a day off work, so he decides to go fishing on his new
boat on Loch Ness. It is a beautiful day, the sun is shining, the lake is calm, and
the fish are biting. Suddenly, his boat is attacked by the Loch Ness monster! In
one easy flip, the beast tosses him and his boat high into the air . . . The monster
then opens its mouth, preparing to swallow the man and his boat whole! As the
man sails head over heels through the air, he cries out: “Oh God! Please help
me!” At once, the ferocious attack stops, the scene freezes in place, and as the
atheist hangs in mid-air, a booming voice comes down from the sky: “I thought
4                                Quantum History


you didn’t believe in me!” “Aww, come on, God! Give me a break!” the man
pleads. “Just a minute ago, I didn’t believe in the Loch Ness monster either!”
    We encounter here a correct formulation of the difference between a
believer and an atheist materialist: a true atheist accepts the horror of Loch
Ness, he knows reality is not what it seems and there are monstrous things
awaiting us out there, but he doesn’t take refuge in god. And this is also the
difference between common reductionist materialist and a true materialist.
When horrors considered “impossible” happen, a reductionist materialist tries
to explain them away as illusions generated by processes in our ordinary
reality, while true materialism (like that of quantum mechanics) accepts the
monstrosities of reality (like the counterintuitive quantum processes). This is
why the title of a recent CNN report “Atheist chaplains are forging a new path
in a changing world”—aligns perfectly with my project in the book: as the
article relates, there are an increasing number of “openly atheist chaplains”
working in American institutions, who don’t “see a contradiction between
[their] beliefs and the work of tending to the human spirit”; in fact, it might
even be an advantage, with one atheist chaplain quoted as saying that “Being
an atheist, nonbeliever, unaffiliated, whatever you want to call yourself, lends
itself really well to chaplaincy because we naturally don’t project our own stuff
on the people.” This is seen as suggesting that “even as the population moves
away from religion, the desire for spirituality and connectedness remains”:

    Fundamental questions that faith has long answered—from why we’re here
    and what it means to live a meaningful life are just as urgent and relevant for
    the nonreligious, especially as humanity grapples with existential threats
    and technological advances that are reshaping our world in ways that are
    still unclear.9

Quantum mechanics is often (from Wheeler and Penrose to Zeilinger)
interpreted in an anti-materialist way (“with quantum waves and entanglements,
matter disappears . . .”), and my goal here is a very old-fashioned one: following
Althusser’s formula that “philosophy represents class struggle in sciences,” with
class antagonism appearing in it as the opposition between materialism and
idealism, my endeavour is to repeat Lenin’s gesture a hundred years later
apropos quantum mechanics and rebuff all attempts to give a spiritualist twist
                                     Introduction                                    5


to its latest development—to paraphrase the famous lines from Gilbert and
Sullivan’s Mikado, I’ve got them all on my list, and none of them will be missed!
Here is the passage from Althusser, which today has the distinct flavour of
another era:

   Marxist-Leninist philosophy, or dialectical materialism, represents the
   proletarian class struggle in theory. In the union of Marxist theory and the
   Workers’ Movement (the ultimate reality of the union of theory and
   practice) philosophy ceases, as Marx said, to “interpret the world.” It
   becomes a weapon with which “to change it”: revolution.10

The first thing to note in this definition is a clear reference to Lacan’s formula of
signifier as that which represents a subject for another signifier: philosophy
functions as a signifier which represents class struggle (the true subject of
history) in theory (science). But how does philosophy relate to psychoanalysis?
Aaron Schuster brings out the unexpected similarity between the two: they
both deal with trivialities. In Logical Investigations Husserl named philosophy
“the science of the trivial” (die Wissenschaft von der Trivialitäten): “It is precisely
behind the obvious that the hardest problems lie hidden, that this is so much
so, in fact, that philosophy may be paradoxically, but unprofoundly, called
the science of the trivial.”11 The technical name for this “triviality” is the
transcendental: when confronted by some key notion of our daily lives (how we
experience the passing of time, the motion of bodies in space, encountering a
living being . . .), philosophy, in contrast to science, does not probe deeply into
the structure of time or life. It remains on the surface of our experience and just
asks: how do we experience time in our everyday life? How do we recognize an
entity as a living being? The focus is here not on “true reality” but on the implicit
set of presuppositions which structure our approach to reality. (For Aristotle,
for example, a living being is an object which moves by itself, without external
pushes.) Modern science also approaches reality through a set of transcendental
presuppositions: “objective reality” is a material network of objects whose
interaction is determined by mechanic laws . . . Scientific discoveries are not
ignored here, the question is rather if and how they change our basic approach
to reality. So where does psychoanalysis come in? It also deals with (what we
experience as) trivialities, but in a thoroughly different way:
6                                 Quantum History


    the most senseless phenomena, those that appear ridiculous, absurd, or
    bereft of significance, can, and should, be made objects of investigation. . . .
    In Freud’s case, this meant dreams, slips of the tongue, bungled actions, and
    neurotic symptoms, the glitches and distortions of mental life.12

Freud himself refers to these phenomena as “trivialities,” and their
psychoanalytic interpretation is not scientific in the ordinary sense of the
term—psychoanalytic interpretation remains in the domain of meaning, i.e.,
in the sphere of the symbolic language. However, this sphere is given an
additional spin: it includes trauma, traumatic cuts which elude meaning, and
this link between trauma and speech determines the notion of truth: truth is
not a report on objective facts but a signifier which intervenes into the subject’s
Real, changing the way it relates to a trauma. This is why David Foster Wallace
was right when he wrote in Infinite Jest: “The truth will set you free. But not
until it’s done with you.” Here, unexpectedly, Freud rejoins Lenin, as Agon
Hamza makes brilliantly clear:

    When Lenin says that what people should know is “the truth,” he is not
    concerned with the truth in the empirical sense but with capturing and
    naming a moment in its temporal uniqueness. For Lenin, theory is not
    merely an activity of observation or of pure thinking, it is also an intervention
    in the historical-political conjuncture. A theoretical statement, just as a
    political proposition (even if it is done in the form of a slogan), does not
    emerge from a distance between the subjective position that announces it
    and the object that is observed. On the contrary, it is done from the militant
    position fully engaged in the object it observes, of which it is a part.
    Differently put, Lenin speaks not only from the position of the proletariat,
    but also from the actuality of the engaged political process/revolution. In
    this sense, language is not a neutral field of representing reality, it is a field
    of struggle, as slogans suggest. The politics of language and the language of
    politics can help us in further elaborating the question of truth and its
    opposites (untruth and non-truth). Direct factual truth expressed in true
    statements, that is to say, in objective neutral knowledge, misses subjective
    truth. Because subjective truth is engaged, included in its object, it cannot
    assume the form of true knowledge enunciated from a safe distance. It can
                                    Introduction                                    7


   only be enacted in the form of factual untruth, through statements which
   distort objective reality and inscribe into it a subjective engagement of a
   political and ideological agent. In other words, subjective truth can only be
   formulated indirectly, in the form of the failure of directly saying the truth.13

Jean-Paul Sartre formulated this paradox in a perfect way apropos Khrushchev’s
report on the XXth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1956 which
revealed Stalin’s crimes: “when the authorities find it useful to tell the truth, it’s
because they can’t find any better lie. Immediately this truth, coming from
official mouths, becomes a lie corroborated by the facts.”14 Here is a recent
example of subjective-engaged truth in the form of untruth. In the fourth
chapter of my Pandemic booklet,15 I argued, via Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill,
that the Covid virus was acting as a kind of “Five Point Palm Exploding
Heart Technique” on Western capitalism, where we are living in the brief
moments between the explosive hit and the death of the victim (neoliberal
capitalism). My point is that this type of dystopian, catastrophic event can
bring about a kind of universal solidarity—we need a catastrophe to rethink
our ways of living . . . At the level of factual truth, my claim is obviously not
true: if anything, the Covid epidemic even strengthened global capitalism,
widened the gap between the poor and the rich, constrained (whatever remains
of) democracy in our societies, etc. However, this factual non-truth nonetheless
functioned as untruth in Hamza’s sense: it is not a neutral description but a
fully engaged subjective truth which enables us to discern progressive elements
in how even some of the most conservative governments reacted to the crisis
(direct social intervention in market mechanisms, recourse to direct citizen’s
income, enforced global cooperation, etc.). In this way we can read the factual
truth (the strengthening of capitalism) as a reaction to the threat to the
system exerted by the pandemic. So it is not only that we escape from reality
to fiction—reality itself can serve as an escape from fiction, from the insight
into new possibilities opened up by a crisis.

The present book follows the logic of UPS: it moves from Universal through
Particular to Singular. It begins with dialectical materialism: the exploration of
the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics as the basis for a new
8                                Quantum History


form of dialectical materialism. It then moves to historical materialism,
confronting Hegel’s and Heidegger’s notion of historicity. We finish with the
singularity of political acts, bringing out the political implications of reading
Hegel through the quantum lenses. The underlying syllogism of the book is
thus that we can return from Heidegger back to Hegel only through the
mediation of quantum universe.
    In addition to the triadically-structured matter of the book, the three parts
divided into chapters following its main argument, I have also written nine
supplemental pieces, or variations, which you can find at the end of the book.
Like variations on a musical theme, these pieces recombine, develop and add
texture to the primary argument. They can be read interleaved with each of the
main chapters, or together at the end.

       Why a Hegelian needs
       quantum mechanics


The exact status of the collapse of a wave function is arguably the key problem
of quantum mechanics—according to Roger Penrose, the fact that this collapse
is external to the quantum space proper (quantum waves) proves that quantum
mechanics is an incomplete or even incorrect theory. Interpretations of
collapse seem to oscillate between the two poles: quantity and observation. For
some, collapse occurs automatically when the assemblage of particles involved
in a quantum wave reaches a certain quantitative level, which is why
superpositions are limited to the most elementary level of subparticles, while
for others, collapse occurs when a quantum process is observed (interpretations
here differ as to what observation means: from mechanical registration
through conscious observer up to formulation in public language). Can we
link these two poles and claim that large-scale processes in our reality only
exist insofar as they are observed? What definitely holds is that observation
functions as a moment when the effect of a quantum process is measured in
our ordinary reality, i.e., a moment of the link between the two levels (quantum
waves and our ordinary reality). Maybe we should risk a parallel with the
symbolic order here (although the idea that collapse occurs only when it is
formulated in our language seems the least probable). Imagine a group of
people who know some embarrassing detail about one (or all) of them, and
also know all others know it—when one of them breaks the silence and makes
what was the public secret really public (a topic of open conversation), the
situation radically changes although nobody learned anything new. Who, then,

                                                                             11
12                               Quantum History


did learn something new? What Lacan calls the “big Other,” the public space of
meaning.
     Magicians know how to manipulate this dimension of the big Other. In a
live TV appearance in 1983, the famous magician David Copperfield made the
Statue of Liberty disappear in front of a couple of dozen people watching in
person from an observation platform and millions of people watching from
home. At that time, no one could tell how he made a 310-foot, 225-pound
copper statue vanish. Now, however, we know it was all in the set up. Copperfield
raised a sheet in front of the statue and when he dropped it, Lady Liberty was
gone. However, she was actually just hidden behind one of the towers that held
the sheet up. David moved the platform everyone was on, using loud music
so the audience wouldn’t know or feel the shift. The move changed their
perspective so that the statue went behind the tower.1 There is an important
lesson in this magic trick: we are seduced insofar as we focus on the object
which seems miraculously to change (disappear), i.e., insofar as we forget to
include into what we observe a possible shift in our own subjective position.
     This is why, as a Hegelian philosopher, I am so fascinated by quantum
mechanics despite the fact that they are definitely strange bedfellows—already
the substantives seem incompatible: “dialectics” versus “mechanics” . . . But
what we find in quantum physics is something that is usually considered an
exclusive feature of the symbolic universe, a self-reflective move of including the
observer’s own subjective position into the series of observed phenomena. Recall
Hegel’s famous infinite judgment “Spirit is a bone”—how does it work? Instead
of arguing (from the safe distance of an observer) that spirit cannot be reduced
to a bone, it begins by endorsing the claim “spirit is a bone”. Our reaction to this
statement is one of shock: we experience this claim as blatant nonsense, as a
radical self-related negativity . . . but it is only through experiencing the
nonsense/negativity of this statement that we arrive at Spirit, because “spirit” is
just such a self-relating negativity which encompasses me in my subjective
stance.2 And exactly the same holds for Christianity: the Christian version of
“Spirit is a bone” is “God is Christ, this miserable ordinary mortal individual.”
The very absurdity of this statement (how can the almighty god be a finite
ordinary human being?) makes us experience the absolute gap, a crack in the
texture of reality, and this gap as such is the foundation of atheism. If we assert
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                      13


atheism directly by comfortably claiming “there is no god, just reality out
there,” we say this from the comfortable position of an outside observer, and it
is this very position—this comfort—that a true atheism should undermine. To
be an atheist is not to possess a certain knowledge, it is to take up an existential
position.
   But what has this to do with quantum mechanics? There also, the only way
to reach the Real is by way of including the observer into the picture. Still, is
the very idea of quantum (the magnitude of the physical property can take on
only discrete values) not foreign to Hegel, who remains well within the
Aristotelian notion of the infinite divisibility? Is it then possible to think
Hegelian dialectics and quantum mechanics together? What feature do they
share? Alenka Zupančič provides the key when she wrote about theatre:

   we start with “repetitions,” for rehearsals are called repetitions, and we end
   up with la première, with the first (performance or the first night). Repetitions
   do not repeat some first occurrence but, rather, lead up to it.3

Can we say, in a similar way, that wave superpositions in quantum mechanics
(multiple virtual paths a particle takes to arrive from point A to point B) are
like theatrical repetitions: they prepare the (back)ground for the premiere
which occurs in their collapse? Collapse comes first, but it is constituted as first
through its “repetitions” (superposed variations): superpositions “do not repeat
some first occurrence but, rather, lead up to it.” Exactly the same paradox is at
work in the very core of Hegelian dialectics: in Hegel’s reading of the Bible, the
Fall (into sin) retroactively constitutes what it is the fall from, i.e., the Good—
as Hegel put it brutally, Paradise before the Fall is simply the animal kingdom.
What this means is that for quantum mechanics there is no happy domain of
free-wave oscillations preceding collapses, a collapse is always-already here . . .
Considering all this messy confusion, one should not be surprised that the
very idea of a collapse as an actual physical event is more and more considered
problematic:

   Recent experiments have mobilized the extreme sensitivity of particle
   physics instruments to test the idea that the “collapse” of quantum possibilities
   into a single classical reality is not just a mathematical convenience but a
14                                 Quantum History


     real physical process—an idea called “physical collapse.” The experiments
     find no evidence of the effects predicted by at least the simplest varieties of
     these collapse models.4

No wonder that those who continue to use the notion of collapse are more and
more tempted to account for it by introducing another factor external to wave
oscillations. As far back as the 1980s and 1990s, Penrose and Lajos Diósi
independently proposed gravity as a possible cause of the collapse: “Loosely
speaking, their idea was that if a quantum object is in a superposition of locations,
each position state will ‘feel’ the others via their gravitational interaction. It is as
if this attraction causes the object to measure itself, forcing a collapse.”5 In spite
of my ignorance of the purely mathematical aspect of this topic, I prefer to insist
that collapse has to be accounted for in terms that are immanent to quantum
waves. The only way to do this is to locate within the very domain of quantum
waves a blind spot, a tension which pushes it towards collapse.
     My hypothesis is thus that wave oscillations already are a reaction to
what, in parallel with the Freudian notion of “primordial repression
(Ur-Verdraengung),” we could call primordial collapse constitutive of the
domain of wave oscillations itself. Consequently, we have two collapses:
the primordial collapse which gives birth to wave oscillations themselves, and
the collapse of waves into our ordinary reality: primordial collapse is a logical
presupposition of quantum waves, it accounts for their inherent instability, for
the fact that they are constitutively out of joint. (I am fully aware of the opposed
meanings of collapse in these two cases: the primordial collapse introduces
instability and tension while the collapse proper is a local attempt to regain
stability.) In Hegelian terms, this duality of collapses is the difference between
abstract self-relating negativity and the determinate negation whose result is a
positive entity.
     I am therefore opposed to all readings of quantum mechanics which ignore
this priority of collapse, to all the narratives on how collapses arise from the
spontaneous immanent development of wave oscillations, as well as to all
attempts which take the opposite path and reduce quantum reality to an effect or
aspect of our ordinary reality.6 Therein resides the basic premise of the present
book, and its first part on quantum mechanics is just a series of superposed
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                       15


variations on this axiom of collapse as the ultimate fact: in place of the “logical”
temporality of a wave function collapsing into our ordinary reality, we have a
para-consistent temporality in which a collapse into our ordinary reality
retroactively posits the wave function. Such a collapsed reality functions as a
hologram (a flat interference pattern which then produces a three-dimensional
image): a surface onto which the multiple superpositions remain inscribed.
   As well as the weird temporality of the collapse in which an effect
retroactively posits its cause, Hegelian dialectics and quantum mechanics
share the feature with which I began this chapter. They are both paradigms in
which the objective Real is only reachable when the observer’s subjective
reality is included in the picture. In quantum mechanics, this leads immediately
to the famous distinction between a wave and a particle—and indeed to the
more speculative, paradoxical identity of “a wave is a particle.”
   Again, how? Let’s dive in medias res of quantum mechanics. The fact that a
particle—say, an electron—takes all possible paths when it travels from point
A to point B means that this particle splits and interacts with itself, not just with
other surrounding particles. One should not miss the Hegelian “speculative”
echo of this formulation (speculative in the precise sense of reducing
multiplicity to a self-relationship of a singular element): what appears as the
interaction of elements external to each other turns out to be the interaction of
one element with itself. The ultimate consequence of this approach was brought
out by Richard Feynman in his classic paper from 1949,7 in which he introduced
his notion of the positron actually being an electron running backward in
time. In the trade-off enacted by Feynman, if we accept running backward in
time, the whole image gets simplified and one element suffices:

   In the approximation of classical relativistic theory the creation of an
   electron pair (electron A, positron B) might be represented by the start of
   two world lines from the point of creation, 1. The world lines of the positron
   will then continue until it annihilates another electron, C, at a world point
   2. Between the times t1 and t2 there are then three world lines, before and
   after only one. However, the world lines of C, B, and A together form one
   continuous line albeit the “positron part” B of this continuous line is directed
   backwards in time. Following the charge rather than the particles
16                               Quantum History


     corresponds to considering this continuous world line as a whole rather
     than breaking it up into its pieces. It is as though a bombardier flying low
     over a road suddenly sees three roads and it is only when two of them come
     together and disappear again that he realizes that he has simply passed over
     a long switchback in a single road.




I am, of course, not qualified to judge the scientific validity of this line of
thought—all I am saying is that, from my Hegelian standpoint, it works
perfectly. What I especially appreciate in it is that something which appeared
to be another positive element of reality (positron) turns out to be something
which differs from its opposite only because of its different temporal line. And
is this not also a proper way to reject the dualism of good and evil? When the
good god himself reaches the point B, he turns back in time to A and becomes
evil (the Old Testament god of wrath and fury), but he then turns around again
and moves upwards to goodness (to love)—in Christianity this happens when
he is born in/as a man in Christ.
     We can see from this example how Hegel’s thought can make a crucial
contribution to quantum theory, supplying a dimension which has been
lacking. When most philosophers mention quantum mechanics, they either
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                     17


focus on its paradoxes for our common sense notions or reduce its philosophical
implications to the fact that reality is not totally deterministic but contains an
irreducible aspect of contingency. A Hegelian approach shows that much more
than contingency takes place in a quantum domain.
   The most direct way to this “much more” is a delayed quantum eraser
experiment, which appears to imply an influence of the future on the past. First
imagined by John Wheeler, the archetypal “physics-for-poets physicist,” this is
a variation on a quantum eraser experiment—itself a variation on the classic
double-split experiment. The quantum eraser experiment

   involves an apparatus with two main sections. After two entangled photons
   are created, each is directed into its own section of the apparatus. Anything
   done to learn the path of the entangled partner of the photon being
   examined in the double-slit part of the apparatus will influence the second
   photon, and vice versa. The advantage of manipulating the entangled
   partners of the photons in the double-slit part of the experimental apparatus
   is that experimenters can destroy or restore the interference pattern in the
   latter without changing anything in that part of the apparatus. Experimenters
   do so by manipulating the entangled photon, and they can do so before
   or after its partner has passed through the slits and other elements of
   experimental apparatus between the photon emitter and the detection
   screen. Under conditions where the double-slit part of the experiment has
   been set up to prevent the appearance of interference phenomena (because
   there is definitive “which path” information present), the quantum eraser
   can be used to effectively erase that information. In doing so, the
   experimenter restores interference without altering the double-slit part of
   the experimental apparatus.8

Wheeler’s variation involves a situation in which the experimenter decides
whether to leave both slits open or to close one off after the electron has already
passed through the barrier—with the same results:

   A variation of this experiment, delayed-choice quantum eraser, allows the
   decision whether to measure or destroy the “which path” information to be
   delayed until after the entangled particle partner (the one going through
18                               Quantum History


     the slits) has either interfered with itself or not. In delayed-choice
     experiments, quantum effects can mimic an influence of future actions on
     past events. However, the temporal order of measurement actions is not
     relevant.9

(One should nonetheless be precise here: such erasure doesn’t change the past,
it changes the present memory of the past—that’s why the quantum affects only
“mimic an influence of future actions on past events.”)
     To put it in a somewhat simplified way, the electrons seem to know in
advance how the physicist will choose to observe it. (This experiment was carried
out in the early 1990s and confirmed Wheeler’s prediction.) Even after a
collapse should have already happened, this collapse can be retroactively
undone and the interference pattern restored. It is as if particles can somehow
“unlearn” that they were observed, as if their past can be erased.

     The interference pattern can be controlled by choosing whether or not
     to learn about a photon’s trajectory after it has already hit the detector.
     The interference stripes only appear when the secondary uncertainty is
     resolved.10

Here we go a step further from the collapse of quantum waves which
retroactively establishes necessity: de-quantified order itself is retroactively
erased and we are back at quantum waves. What this means is that even the
collapse of wave superpositions, which arguably provides the basic form of a
temporal cut between “before” and “after,” can be undone. How should reality
be structured so that such paradoxes become possible?
     To explain the present state of a physical system, the usual scientific
approach needs two elements: the original situation (boundary conditions)
and the laws that determine the evolution of the original situation into its
present state. Relying on John Wheeler and others, Thomas Hertog11 adds a
third element: observership, his way of describing the involvement of an
observer, who is not just a passive witness but focuses their attention on some
parts of the observed state by way of asking questions and in this way regulates,
directs even, the evolution of a system, even when that evolution happened in
the past:
                      Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                       19


   The triptych evokes the idea that this grand question [of the origins of the
   universe] retroactively draws into existence those few branches of cosmological
   history that have properties that are being observed. Observership in quantum
   cosmology . . . is an indispensable part of the continual process through which
   physical reality—and physical theory, we argue—come about.
                                                                             (188–9)

Into this tripartite approach—the original situation, the laws that determine
the evolution of the original situation, and observership—is built “the
counterintuitive idea that . . . history at the very deepest level emerges backward
in time”:

   It is as if a constant flux of quantum acts of observation retroactively carves
   out the outcome of the big bang, from the number of dimensions that grow
   large to the types of forces and particles that arise.
                                                                                (189)

The backward movement (in which a recent “collapse” retroactively changes/
reconstructs the past) has to be supplemented by a no less paradoxical forward
movement in time; the temporality in quantum processes is double.
   We arrive at the same conclusion if we perform the “double-slit experiment”
which is today a part of common knowledge: waves that pass through two
narrow, parallel slits will form an interference pattern on a screen behind the
wall with two slits. But what happens if you shoot a single photon at the double
slits? Even though there’s only one photon shot at a time, it still forms an
interference pattern. It’s as if the photon travels through both slits simultaneously:
if even photons shot one after the other so that the second photon is shot after
the first one already hit the screen, this means that “each individual particle
senses both slits.”(89) (Perhaps, the Lacanian notion of the “knowledge in the
real” is more appropriate here: it is as if each particle knows about the entire
situation of the two slits and its observation.) We should thus treat

   each individual photon as a propagating wave function that fragments at
   the slits, spreads, and intermingles with itself on the far side, creating a
   pattern of high and low probabilities.
                                                                                (192)
20                               Quantum History


However, if you set up detectors in front of each slit to determine which slit the
photon really goes through, the interference pattern doesn’t show up at all.12
Wheeler accounted for this conundrum with yet another analogy. He likened
the job of a physicist to that of someone playing Twenty Questions in its
“surprise” version. In this variant of the old game, one person leaves the room
while the rest of the group—or so the excluded person thinks—agrees on some
person, place or thing. He then re-enters the room and tries to guess what they
have in mind with a series of questions that can only be answered with a yes or
a no. But unbeknownst to the guesser, the group has decided to play a trick on
him. The first person to be queried will only think of an object and answer the
question after the questioner asks his question. Each person after that will do the
same, making sure that his response is consistent not only with the immediate
question but also with all previous questions. “The word wasn’t in the room
when I came in even though I thought it was,” Wheeler explained. In the same
way, the electron, before the physicist chooses how to observe it, is neither a wave
nor a particle. It is in some sense unreal; it exists in an indeterminate limbo. So,
as Hawking said: “The history of the universe depends on the question you ask.”
Or, to quote Wheeler again: “Not until you start asking a question, do you get
something. The situation cannot declare itself until you’ve asked your question.
But the asking of one question prevents and excludes the asking of another.”13
     This same logic allows us a new way to approach the enigma of the
improbability of intelligent life on Earth: In order for life on Earth to be
possible, our cosmos—which existed billions of years before life emerged—
would have to be composed in an extremely improbable way. If we read the
history of the cosmos bottom-up, then the answer that imposes itself is, of
course, god and teleology: some higher force had to direct the evolution of the
cosmos in the direction of the possibility of intelligent life . . . But in the
top-down approach the probability distribution

     is of no significance because “we” have already measured that we live in a
     universe with three large dimensions of space.
                                                                              (199)

Or, as Lacan would have put it, a letter always arrives at its destination not
because of some hidden teleology guaranteeing this outcome but because
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                      21


“destination” is retroactive: the destination of a letter is contingent but the
point at which a letter contingently arrives is its destination. It is here that we
come once again to the idea of a hologram: “The latest incarnation of
holography envisions that everything in the four dimensions we experience is
in fact a manifestation of a hidden reality located on a thin slice of spacetime.”
(212) As [x] wrote, it is “almost as if you could learn everything about the
interior of an orange by meticulously analyzing its skin.” (225) Plato’s vision is
thus turned on its head, or, perhaps, inside out—the flat image of a thing is its
reality, while the real thing is a copy of its image.
                                          *
To clarify this key point, let me return, for the nth time, to Claude Levi-Strauss’s
exemplary analysis, from his Structural Anthropology, of the spatial disposition
of buildings among the Winnebago. The tribe, one of the Great Lakes tribes,
is divided into two sub-groups (“moieties”), “those who are from above”
and “those who are from below”. When an individual is asked to draw the
ground-plan of his/her village (the spatial disposition of cottages), there are
two quite different results, depending on the sub-group the individual belongs
to. Both perceive the village as a circle; but for one sub-group, there is within
this circle another circle of central houses, so that we have two concentric
circles, while for the other sub-group, the circle is split into two by a clear
dividing line. In other words, a member of the first sub-group (let us call it
“conservative-corporatist”) perceives the ground-plan of the village as a ring
of houses more or less symmetrically disposed around the central temple,
whereas a member of the second (“revolutionary-antagonistic”) sub-group
perceives their village as two distinct heaps of houses separated by an invisible
frontier.14
   The point Levi-Strauss wants to make is that this example should in no way
entice us into cultural relativism, according to which the perception of social
space depends on the observer’s group-belonging: the very splitting into two
“relative” perceptions implies a hidden reference to a constant—not the
objective,“actual” disposition of buildings but a traumatic kernel, a fundamental
antagonism the inhabitants of the village were unable to symbolize, to account
for, to “internalize,” to come to terms with, an imbalance in social relations that
prevented the community from stabilizing itself into a harmonious whole.15
22                               Quantum History


The two perceptions of the ground-plan are simply two mutually exclusive
endeavours to cope with this traumatic antagonism, to heal its wound via the
imposition of a balanced symbolic structure. We get here a clear distinction
between the external reality—the “actual,” “objective,” arrangement of the
houses—and the Real that announces itself in the clash of the two different
symbolizations which both distort in an anamorphic way the actual
arrangement. The “real” here is not the actual arrangement, but the traumatic
core of some social antagonism which distorts the tribe members’ view of the
actual arrangement of the houses in their village.
     The common-sense realist notion of things-in-themselves was best
encapsulated in Karl Kautsky’s anti-Kantian argument against the
unknowability of things-in-themselves (from his Materialist Conception of
History, published in German in 1927 and not yet translated into English):
different subjects perceive an object in different ways, each in accordance with
its cognitive limitations. To know this object “really,” independently of our
subjective perception, we do not need to step out of ourselves and assume an
impossible god-like objective view; all we need to do is to compare different
perceptions of an object. The differences between them are obviously caused
by the cognitive limitations of the subjects doing the observing, they don’t
belong to the object as it is in itself, while features which remain the same in all
different perceptions no less obviously belong to the object itself. This line of
argumentation is doubly wrong. Not only does it ignore the possibility that
subjective limitation is not individual but generic, the result of the complex
perceptual and semiotic history of humanity, but much more importantly, it
misses the key dialectical insight into how the Real (as opposed to external
reality) is the very antagonism that different discordant perceptions (or, rather,
appearances) or even constructions of reality try to obfuscate.
     And it would be easy to add numerous similar examples from contemporary
political life—if one were, say, to ask a partisan of Trump or of the liberal
center-Left to describe the basic coordinates of the American political scene,
we would get each time a fundamentally different description (Trump as the
voice of the hard-working people against the corrupted non-patriotic “enemies
of the people,” the liberal Left as the last bulwark of human rights and freedom
against Fascist demagoguery), and the Real of this opposition is not provided
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                     23


by the description of social reality as it is but by the antagonism that both poles
of the opposition obfuscate, each in its own way.
   So it is not that we just get two distorted images/drawings of reality: reality
itself (the actual disposition of houses/huts) is an imaginary hologram which
condenses two mutually exclusive symbolic forms. And do we not get in this
holographic duality—the same thing in two descriptions, like wave/particle—a
parallax at its purest? There is no higher-level drawing that would unite the
two: the only thing that unites the two drawings is the underlying antagonism
itself. So we have three different levels: the imaginary surface of reality (actual
disposition of houses), two incompatible symbolic structures, and the real of
their underlying antagonism. Perhaps we can risk a parallel with what, in
quantum mechanics, Bohr called “complementarity”: the idea that a quantum
entity can be measured as a wave or as a particle but not as both at the same
time. What I want to add is that, since this notion of complementarity is the
exact opposite of complementarity that characterizes some phenomena in our
ordinary reality (the co-dependence of opposed features like male and female),
it means that the quantum complementarity cannot be grounded in some
substantial base shared by both features (waves and particles); it rather
presupposes a pure tension or antagonism. And what if this brings us to the
ontological origin of time, in which what cannot coexist resolves its tension in
time where one can occur after the other? However, holographic cosmology
tends to reduce the parallax tension to the classic duality of the true basic
reality of a hologram and the standard reality of our expanding universe:

   If, as holographic cosmology posits, the surface of our observations is in
   some sense all there is, then this builds in the backward-in-time operation
   that is the hallmark of top-down cosmology. Holography tells us that there
   is an entity more basic than time—a hologram—from which the past
   emerges. The evolving and expanding universe would be output, not input
   in a holographic universe.
                                                                             (243)

How far can we go in this direction? Wheeler is famous for proposing the
phrase “the it from bit”: “every it—every particle, every field of force, even the
spacetime continuum itself—derives its function, its meaning, its very existence
24                                Quantum History


entirely—even if in some contexts indirectly—from the apparatus-elicited
answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits.”16 Is this formula not the
ultimate scientific version of the fundamental ontological premise of Western
metaphysics, in which whatever exists in reality (any “it”) results from some
“bit,” from a cognitive logical matrix? If we follow this path, we end up in a new
version of idealism, the timeless network of qubits out of which “it,” our reality,
emerges, so that the ultimate reality “may be better thought of as a mathematical
realm that can inform physics but need not exist as such” (247):

     quantum information inscribed in an abstract timeless hologram of
     entangled qubits forms the thread that weaves reality. . . . It is as if there
     is a code, operating on countless entangled qubits, that brings about
     physical reality.
                                                                          (244–5)

This basic reality of qubits is at the same time in the past and in our future,
since we are not yet able (not just to discover but simultaneously) to create it:
holography “places the true origin of the universe in the distant future, because
only the far future would reveal the hologram in its full glory.”(245) What
remains here of the Darwinian insight that “not the laws as such but their
capacity to change and transmute would have the final word”? (246) What
remains of the idea of overcoming “the separation between law-like dynamics
and ad hoc boundary conditions as a fundamental property of nature”? (80)
Or, as Hawking put it, for the classic physical science,

     theoretical physics will have achieved its goal when we have obtained a set
     of local dynamic laws. They would regard the question of the boundary
     conditions of the universe as belonging to the realm of metaphysics or
     religion. But we shall not have a complete theory until we can do more than
     merely say that things are as they are because they were as they were.
                                                                              (82)

The only alternative to this idealist vision (or, rather, its necessary supplement)
is a self-limitation, i.e., the claim that “we are living in a patch of spacetime,
surrounded by an ocean of uncertainty about which, well, we must remain
silent.” (247) So there is a boundary to (our) cosmos, a boundary which does
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                     25


not reside in its outer limits but is implied by the very position in which we
find ourselves as observers and from which, in a top-bottom approach, we
reconstruct the cosmos. This would have been the quantum cosmology version
of the Hegelian infinite judgment: the entire external cosmos equals (or is
correlative to) the observer’s eye.
   What these counterintuitive thoughts imply is that philosophy returns with
a vengeance in today’s quantum physics. The old question of the ontological
status of wave functions, not just ignored but outright prohibited by Bohr and
the Copenhagen orthodoxy, is today answered by the claim that quantum
waves describe “the world at some kind of preexistence level” (88) since what
exists in/as our reality is only the outcomes of the collapse of the quantum
superpositions. At this preexistence level, particles “follow all possible paths
when they move from one point to another” (90): in a double-slit experiment,
“individual electrons follow not one but every possible path from the gun to
the screen. One path takes the electron through the left slit, another through
the right, back out through the left, into a U-turn, and through the right slit
once more.” (91) Along these lines, Feynman proposed the path integral
formulation which replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory
for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of quantum-
mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude. The path
integral formulation thus suggests that “our reality is a sort of blending—a
sum—of all imaginable possibilities.”17
   Here is another unexpected use of superposition in sexuality. For a sexual
conservative like me, there are two main options with regards to getting
married. First, it seems better not to get married because in this way you
display trust in your love: you don’t need an external legal limitation that
obliges you to fidelity, your love itself is enough of a guarantee. (However,
there is a deeper paradox at work in marriage: when marriage mostly no longer
has the patriarchal function of securing succession, it may also be read as a
commitment to love you even when I will no longer really love you . . .) Second,
if you are married, it opens up a way to dream about cheating on your wife
without feeling guilty—you can tell yourself “I am just dreaming about it, I
know I will not do it because I am married . . .” Is there a way out of this rather
debilitating deadlock? It’s certainly not simply being married and loving your
26                               Quantum History


wife—the gap between the law and desire is irreducible. But what about being
married and dreaming about cheating on your wife . . . with herself, not with
another woman (or man or . . .)? Crazy and inconsistent as this version may
appear, many married people are doing it, practicing a kind of superposition
of fidelity and promiscuity: while I make love to my wife, I imagine she is not
my wife.
     As has been established already in this chapter, in quantum experiments
there are often situations which do not fit the ordinary notion of time as a
linear movement from the past to the future. There seems only two explanations
which can account for the results of such experiments: Either (a) two elements
(like entangled photons) can interact faster than the speed of light, which
means that there is another dimension of reality beneath or beyond our
ordinary reality in which instant interaction between elements far away is
possible; or (b) at some specific level of quantum reality, time can run
backwards, from the future to the past—not at some metaphoric level (like
symbolic reinterpretation of the past) but at the literal physical level. Are these
two options just two versions of the same underlying phenomenon?
     Such paradoxes surprisingly induced Hawking (who otherwise despised
philosophy) to call for a new philosophy for cosmology. (167) In his view, “a
proper quantum outlook” would require “a different philosophy of cosmology
in which we work from the top down, backward in time, starting from the
surface of our observation.” (175) Can we apply the top-down approach to
the universe itself, so that it has multiple pasts? Hawking’s final answer is yes—
the premise of his new philosophy is that we should abandon the idea that “the
universe has a global classical state. We live in a quantum universe so it should
be described by a superposition of histories a la Feynman, each with its own
probability.” (174) Or, to quote Hertog’s paraphrase:

     we should adopt a full-blown quantum view not just of what’s happening
     within the universe—the wave functions of particles and strings and so
     forth—but of the cosmos as a whole. . . . we should think of the universe as
     a superposition of many possible spacetimes. So a quantum universe is
     uncertain even on the very largest scales, on scales well beyond our
     cosmological horizon like those associated with eternal inflation. And that

   large-scale cosmic fuzziness puts a bomb under the eternal background
   that the multiverse aficionados assume exists.
                                                                             (174)

This means that we shouldn’t imagine the Big Bang as a singularity that then
explodes but as a primordial fuzziness in which time bends into space (130)—
no wonder Hertog quotes Wagner’s Parsifal, “I hardly move, yet far I seem to
have come. You see, son, here time becomes space” [zum Raum wird hier die
Zeit.] (72) Or, to quote Hertog, “in the very early universe, quantum effects
would have blurred the very distinction between space and time, causing them
to suffer a bit of an identity crisis, with intervals of time sometimes behaving
like intervals of space and vice versa.” (94) The singularity at the bedrock of the
classical universe, that event without a cause that seemingly put the beginning
outside science, is therefore replaced by “a smooth and rounded quantum
origin complying with the laws of physics everywhere.” (95)
   The fact that there is no pure singularity of the absolute beginning where
all laws of nature break down implies a further, radically counterintuitive
conclusion: there is no zero-level at which things (or, rather processes) just
happen without being in some sense observed. Even the remotest past is
retroactively generated by an observer: “What matters is not what is most
probable in the theory but what is most probable to be observed. Cosmological
histories that don’t produce observers don’t quite count when we compare our
theories to our observations.” (127) However, are there different universes for
different observers? How do we locate ourselves in this multitude of observers?
“Einstein showed that gravity is a manifestation of warped spacetime.
Holography goes further and postulates that warped spacetime is woven from
quantum entanglement.”(235) In what precise sense do entanglements occur
only for observers?
   Let’s begin with the notion of entropy, a concept that is most commonly
associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. Entropy is
central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of
an isolated system left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time. As
a result, isolated systems evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, where
the entropy is highest. A consequence of the second law of thermodynamics is
28                                Quantum History


that such processes are irreversible. In 1928, Arthur Eddington endeavoured to
explain the nature of time, order, and the universe in terms of entropy:

     If you take a pack of cards as it comes from the maker and shuffle it for a few
     minutes, all traces of the original systematic order disappears. The order will
     never come back however long you shuffle. There is only one law of nature—
     the second law of thermodynamics—which recognizes a distinction between
     the past and the future. Its subject is the random element in a crowd. A
     practical measure of the random element which can increase in the universe
     but never decrease is called entropy.

In this way Eddington offers a thermodynamic explanation of time’s arrow: a
direction of time emerges from irreversible growing entropy.18 However, many
scientists (Carlo Rovelli among them) have pointed out that we cannot talk
about entropy as a universal law of reality since a process of entropy always
implies a measure of order with regard to which disorder is growing. The
parallel with quantum physics is clear: in order to detect a line of growing
entropy, we “collapse” the chaotic reality by way of selecting a specific notion of
measure. When we buy a new pack of cards, they are usually ordered by color
(in the English Poker format, there are black spades, red hearts, blue diamonds
and green clubs), and within each of these four groups cards are ordered by
their value (first aces, then kings . . .), and in this case some shuffling of the
pack can lower entropy. But if we buy a standard card pack and measure its
order by the value of cards (first the four aces, etc.), then some shuffling may
even lower entropy . . . Low entropy measured by some standards can mean
higher entropy measured by a different standard—let’s take the case of the
development from medieval to modern society in Europe. Measured by some
criteria, this development brought much more entropy: instead of the stability
of organic hierarchies we got chaotic individualism and market exchanges.
However, measured by different criteria, medieval societies were much more
chaotic, with permanent wars and plagues—a relatively stable social life
emerged only in a modern state. In literature, the same holds for Walter Scott’s
Waverley: the defeat of premodern “organic” life of Scottish clans with the
victory of modern legal state at the same time pushes those who do not want
to accommodate themselves to this order outside the legal order, they become
                      Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                       29


bandits . . . The point is that there is no global standard encompassing all reality,
so in all of reality there is neither entropy nor progress towards order. This is
important because if we perceive growing entropy as the ultimate reference of
the flow of time, then it immediately becomes clear that there is no global flow
of time encompassing all of reality. For this same reason, I tend to disagree
with Smolin in his parallel between science and democracy:

   Scientists know even the best ideas will eventually need to be updated by
   new insights, and will be, from time to time, replaced by revolutionary new
   conceptions. Similarly, democratic governance gives people the power to
   vote a government out of office when its effectiveness diminishes or when
   events show that its election was a mistake.19

Does this parallel not rely on an all too simple notion of progress? Do we not
now live precisely in an era of big regress, of a total disorientation? Plus is it not
the case that, in the course of (historical) time, the very standards of progress
are changing? (For anti-abortion fundamentalists, the prohibition of abortion
is the necessary great step in the progress towards equality: first women were
proclaimed equal to men, then other races were proclaimed equal to the whites,
and now unborn humans should be proclaimed equal to the already-born . . .)
And, last but not least, what if the majority turns against science and acts in a
racist way against refugees and immigrants, etc.?
   Quantum mechanics and general relativity force us at this point to take not
one but two steps further—steps which also have repercussions for our notion
of history. It is not enough to say that there is no progress (or regression) in
general—such a negation still presupposes that all events take place within the
same all-encompassing form of time and space. But what if there is no universal
form of time and space, what if space and (especially) time always emerge in a
specific physical constellation, so that there are multiple space/times with no
common spatio-temporal measure that unites them? One step further: if
space/time is not universal, then multiple space/times must be rooted in some
more basic level of reality which is, according to some theorists, spatial, and
according to others, outside space and time. The notion that as a rule appears
here is that of a ‘ “block universe”: at its most basic level, reality is an atemporal
block in which past, present and future co-exist simultaneously within the
30                                Quantum History


same space, and we experience time only due to the limitations of what our
point of observation allows us to perceive.
     Along these lines, Rovelli claims that time is an effect of our ignorance. Time
exists because we cannot see everything everywhere all at once, we cannot
access a total view of reality: “if I could take into account all the details of the
exact, microscopic state of the world, would the characteristic aspects of the
flowing of time disappear? Yes. If I observe the microscopic state of things,
then the difference between past and future vanishes.”20 Why? Because the
changes regulated by physical laws are “symmetric[al] between future and past.”
(30) This is because of the nature of entropy (growing disorder), to which,
Rovelli argues, the difference between past and future may be solely attributed.
However, entropy appears only if we measure a starting point as that of order—
“every configuration is particular, every configuration is singular, if we look at
all of its details.”(29) Rovelli evokes here a short science-fiction novel
(co-authored by Alain Connes and two of his friends) in which Charlotte, the
protagonist, “manages to have for a moment a totality of information about
the world, without blurring. She manages to ‘see’ the world directly, beyond
time,”(123) and when she is gradually returning to our blurred image of reality,
she falls back into time.
     But does quantum indeterminacy not imply that reality is in itself blurred,
“muddled,” so that the limitation of our observations is grounded in the
incompleteness of reality itself? Rovelli generally opposes “our confused
fantasies about the supposed freedom of the future,” (48) but he himself wrote:
“The intrinsic quantum indeterminacy of things produces a blurring which
ensures—contrary to what classic physics seemed to indicate—that the
unpredictability of the world is maintained even if it were possible to measure
everything that is measurable.” (123) And, to risk even a step further, does this
“unpredictability” not point—not towards freedom but—towards some kind
of openness of the future?
     If the “true reality” of fields and waves is out of time and space, then time
and space are in some basic sense illusory. However, isn’t the underlying
scheme of basic reality and illusory appearances false in the same way as its
opposite, the gradual progress towards higher forms? What pushes this
pre-ontological quantum space towards collapses and/or towards our common
                     Why a Hegelian needs Quantum Mechanics                     31


reality must be some immanent impossibility, a “barred One,” or some
“boundary” (beyond which there is nothing—a boundary which coincides
with its Beyond, i.e., which is itself inaccessible) in the basic quantum space
itself.
   The problem is then to explain how and why—although the fundamental
theory of the world “does not need a time variable: it needs to tell us only how
the things that we see in the world vary with respect to each other.” (103–4)—
“the things that we see in the world” are always perceived by us as things that
exist in space and time. How, in that case, can the movement of change be in
some sense prior to space/time? For Hegel, space and time (as self-negated
space) are logically prior to movement: movement means that an element
changes its position in space, for which a minimal time is needed (first, the
element was at the position x, then it moved to the position y). If, in quantum
mechanics, change comes before space/time, is this not evidence that Hegel’s
logic doesn’t cover the quantum universe? To clarify this key point somewhat,
let go back to the duality of world in itself and our perspective on it:

   From our perspective—the perspective of a creatures who make up a small
   part of the world—we see the world flowing in time. Our interaction with
   the world is partial, which is why we see it in a blurred way. To this blurring
   is added quantum indeterminacy.
                                                                             (169)

I detect here a certain ambiguity: the first factor (the limitation of our
perspective) makes the world appear blurred to us, so that we can still imagine
how from a complete global perspective the world is not blurred, but quantum
indeterminacy makes it blurred in itself. This brings us back to entropy: the
illusion of a single line of the flow of time is (to simplify things to the utmost)
the outcome of the fact that we, all of humanity, share the same perspective of
living in a world of growing entropy. Entropy also explains why we remember
the past and not the future: it is not simply because the future didn’t yet happen
but because the flow of time is based on increasing entropy—entropy was
lower in the past, and (what appears from our standpoint) as the greater order
of things in the past leaves traces in our present. “Since our future is based on
growing disorder, it cannot leave traces to us: this fact is the origin of our
32                                 Quantum History


sensation of being able to act freely in the world, choosing between different
futures, even though we are unable to act upon the past.”(144–5)
     Rovelli claims that “traces” of the past exist (persist in our present) because
of entropy (traces of lower entropy in higher entropy)—but what happens
when we have a collapse of quantum waves? Are there also traces of multiple
wave superpositions after the collapse? Is this not the base of quantum
computing? Moreover, how is this notion of the traces of superpositions linked
to what Hertog calls the top-down view? The main point here is: what if there
is a one-directional cut between the past and the future: the collapse of a wave
function itself which is irreversible? Does time begin here? Lee Smolin seems
to move in this direction when he claims that

     the fundamental distinction is not the difference between the past, present,
     and future. The fundamental distinction is between some properties that
     are incompletely known or indefinite, and some quantities that are definite,
     and that when an event is, is a moment of transition of some indefinite
     quantity becoming definite. . . . we have an operational meaning of now.
     Basically, an event is part of now if it has been created but it hasn’t yet made
     all the children it’s going to make . . . that gives us a notion of a present, and
     that’s the fundamentals of this.21

Isn’t this ‘ “now” defined precisely by a collapse into a definite reality which
remains open towards the future (since “it hasn’t yet made all the children it’s
going to make”)? There is a parallel with Lacan here: for Lacan, drive is
atemporal, permanent, while desire is temporal, oriented towards a goal.
Moreover, is what Hegel calls the “night of the world” in which dismembered
bodies float not the atemporal/spaceless process, and does Ego as a fixed point
not emerge through the encounter with an Other (symbolic Ego ideal)? So is
the Self/Ego not the outcome of a collapse of the mix of superpositions (that is
the dismembered body) when this mix interacts with an Other?
     Here, we stumble once again upon a question that haunts us all the time: how
does time/space, as a neutral medium/container in which entities exist, emerge?
It is not enough to elevate one variable to this position—there must already be
a space, an opening for it. Does it not imply that already in pre-ontological flux
there is an imbalance, a tendency towards an impossible point?

  Why quantum mechanics
       needs Hegel


In his On the Origin of Time,1 Thomas Hertog forcefully asserts the quantum
nature of the big bang. For two decades he was a collaborator and friend of
Stephen Hawking, and together they probed into a deeper level of evolution in
which laws of physics themselves transform and simplify until particles, forces,
and even time fades away. The laws of physics are not set in stone but are born
and co-evolve as the universe they govern takes shape. As Hawking’s final days
drew near, the two collaborators published a theory which proposed a radical
new Darwinian perspective on the origins of our universe: the laws of nature
were at the beginning multiple, caught in a Darwinian struggle for survival, and
our laws are the laws which won. Is this not a supreme case of how a general law
of nature contingently emerges out of a contingent singular situation?
   What is the link to quantum physics here? Is it that our (deterministic)
reality emerges through a collapse which functioned like the outcome of
Darwinian competition? Quantum mechanics undermines our common
notion of reality: it “leads to a different philosophy of cosmology in which we
work from the top down, backward in time, starting from the surface of our
observations.” It is easy to see how this backward transformation works in our
symbolic universe: we don’t change the facts of what happened in the past, we
just locate it into a different symbolic context, we change its meaning . . . Such
symbolic efficiency plays a key role in our lives. Consider the “trillion-dollar
coin” strategy proposed in 2011 to reduce the national debt, in which the US
government would mint a physical coin, made of platinum, with a face value of


                                                                               33
34                                 Quantum History


$1 trillion.2 Do we not encounter here symbolic efficiency at its purest: a little
bit of real (a small coin) just staying locked in a state bank would deeply affect
the entire financial—and therewith also economic—situation of a country?
     An obvious counter-argument imposes itself here: is not such retroactive
transformation of the past something that can be done only within a symbolic
order? Is it not something similar to well-known fake paintings in which Jesus
is wearing the cross when he was still alive, before his crucifixion? Observation,
whichever way we conceive it, is part of our normal reality in which time runs
forward and causality works from the past to the future; more precisely,
observation is the moment of the collapse of superpositions and wave
oscillations into a single reality—so how can observation provide the opening
for a movement backwards in time? The answer resides in the specific notion
of quantum holograms. Conor Costick defines quantum holography as the
idea of a “a three-dimensional boundary hologram that projects the four-
dimensional universe as we know it”.3
     In common three-dimensional reality, time runs forward. In a holographic
universe, there is no time, everything is here: “The boundary hologram does
not feature time: time only emerges as you make the transition from the
boundary to the universe we are used to.” Costick argues that understanding
the universe as a hologram does not mean that our senses encounter the
experience of existing within it differently, but rather opens up the tantalizing
possibility that “we are only accessing it from one side of a duality. It’s a bit like
only ever having encountered light as a wave but finding out that it is just as
valid to experience it as a sequence of particles.” There is thus a duality to the
universe—not least in terms of time:

     Viewed from within the projection, it feels like there is time: there is causality
     and a progression from the Big Bang to where we are today. But that’s only a
     partial grasp on the situation. Viewed as a hologram, the universe is timeless
     and if you could translate the information from the boundary where the
     hologram is described, you could see the entire history of the universe. We
     are immersed in time and simultaneously in a timeless state.

The first problem we encounter here is the question of whether the parallax of
temporality and the timeless “block” universe in which past, present, and future
                        Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                           35


coexist a true parallax, two incompatible views, or are we dealing with a
relationship between “true” reality and illusory appearance? The block universe
basically reduces time (temporal change) to space: everything there is exists in an
eternal present, and the flow of time is just the illusion due to our limited view
constrained to the present. The purest version of the block-universe in which time
is reduced to a secondary dimension is that put forward by Carlo Rovelli,
who argued that time emerges from the laws of quantum mechanics and
thermodynamics and that we project linear progressions of past, present, and
future on to the messy events of reality. We perceive time passing simply because
we’re not capable of seeing the world in all its detail; if we could know the positions
and speeds of all the particles in the universe—i.e., if we were not subject to
quantum uncertainty—“there would be no entropy, and no unraveling of time.”4
   Rovelli spells out clearly the ontological implications of this view: what we
experience as our temporal reality “is not a fundamental constituent of the
world,” it only appears to us

   because the world is immense, and we are small systems within the
   world, interacting only with macroscopic variables that average among
   innumerable small, microscopic variables. We, in our everyday lives, never
   see a single elementary particle, or a single quantum of space. We see stones,
   mountains, the faces of our friends—and each of these things we see is
   formed by myriads of elementary components. We are always correlated
   with averages: they disperse heat and, intrinsically, generate time. . . . Time is
   an effect of our overlooking of the physical microstates of things. Time is
   information we don’t have. Time is our ignorance.
                                                                             (222–3)5

What this means, at the level of ontology, is that “we must not confuse what we
know about a system with the absolute state of the same system. What we know
is something concerning the relation between the system and ourselves.”(223)
What really exists out there, reality in itself, “the absolute state of the system,” is
composed of quantum events and their interactions which take place outside
time, and we should strictly distinguish this reality-in-itself from the way reality
appears to us due to the limitation of our view—the classical metaphysical
difference between reality and appearances returns here with a vengeance, and
36                                 Quantum History


Parmenides wins over Heraclitus. No wonder Einstein viewed with sympathy the
idea of a block universe and played with it—this idea is not a crazy extrapolation
but a necessary implication of a fully deterministic view of the universe.
     Einstein’s full determinism relies on a religious foundation—he wrote:
“Raffiniert ist der Herrgott, aber boshaft ist er nicht.”6 (God is subtle, but he is not
intentionally deceiving us—or, in a more vague and descriptive translation:
“Nature hides her secret because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of
[a] ruse.”) Although Einstein repeatedly pointed out that he didn’t believe in a
personal god, he proclaimed himself deeply religious: “Our limited minds cannot
grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations.” “I believe in Spinoza’s
God, who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exists.”7 In this sense, for him
religion and science necessarily coexist: science itself is sustained by the deep
faith that our universe is marvelously arranged in a harmony that pervades all
that exists. In Lacanian terms, Einstein believed in the big Other, and it is this
very belief which has been dealt a mortal blow by quantum mechanics.
     Consequently, the only way to really save time—in whatever form—is to
conceive reality as not-all, as incomplete, and in this sense as open towards the
future. What this means is that what Rovelli calls the “absolute state” of reality,
its complete description, is not only out of reach to us finite limited observers,
it is in itself a meaningless notion that should be abandoned. The “ignorance”
that separates us, our view, from the absolute state of reality is immanent to
reality itself—reality is “in itself ” barred, crossed by an impossibility. Usually
idealists privilege time (our thoughts happen in time but cannot be located in
space), while materialists insist on the irreducible character of space (even our
thoughts have to be located in the spatial reality of our brain); but we should
reverse this hierarchy. The standpoint of quantum holography also obliges us
to adopt a radically new view on the Big Bang—from within the universe as it
appears to us, it seems reasonable to wonder what happened “before” the Big
Bang, but considered from the other side of the time/not-time duality, the idea
that there was any “before” no longer makes any sense:

     It is not like there is a giant clock standing outside of the universe; nor the
     fundamental laws that when we apply them to the initial conditions will
     allow us to model the development of the universe. What lies beyond or
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                       37


   before the universe? We can’t say because there is nothing to speak with:
   there is no information on the hologram about this.8

To understand this, we should make a step further into the weird ontology
implied by quantum physics and conceive observation as integral to
understanding reality. As Hertog writes:

   If you had a conventional Western education like mine, then science is
   taught as the discovery of laws of nature that are always exact, regardless of
   whether anyone or anything is watching. In the quantum world, a particle
   is in a superposition of possible positions and velocities, described by a
   wave function, until one of these is fixed by an observation (the other one
   then, necessarily, becoming unknowable).9

Hawking and Hertog avoid getting lost in the debate on what really counts as
observation—they endorse the broadest view: “The observer doesn’t have to
be human or sentient. Any record of quantum events is a form of observation,
so when a quartz crystal preserves the path of a subatomic particle that passed
through it, the crystal acts as an observer.”10 This wide notion of what counts as
observation enables us to avoid the onto-theological trap to which physics
sometimes succumbs.
   Newtonian physics, Hertog writes, was grounded in a concept of God as the
ultimate and absolute observer; space was the “sensorium” of God, position in
space was the position of the object in the eyes of God. In other words, the
ontology of empty space as a container of everything that materially exists has
to be grounded in a supreme entity—a different iteration of what Heidegger
called the onto-theological structure of metaphysics.”
   With general relativity, however,

   we have been learning that we do not need this frame to keep reality in place.
   Reality keeps itself in place. Objects interact with other objects, and this is
   reality. Reality is the net of these interactions. [. . .] We do not need an
   external entity to hold this net. We do not need Space, to hold the universe.
                                                                             (32)

This is also why we should reject the reading of quantum mechanics which
proposes a supreme Observer (sometimes god is directly evoked) which fully
38                                Quantum History


constitutes reality—it again regresses to onto-theology. Nonetheless, the basic
claim of quantum mechanics—that only when a wave function is observed
does it “collapse” into an actual route (prior to that moment, it was traveling
through all possible routes)—explains what Hawking and Hertog mean by
top-down cosmology:

     The universe is a quantum universe and even the distant past, when no
     observers existed, can be selected by observation today. [. . .] the quasar
     light is in a state of superposition until we switch on the telescope. The
     history of quantum activity isn’t fixed until an observation has taken place;
     current and future events select the past. In the same way, when we make
     observations about the universe, we are assisting in creating the answer.11

Wheeler drew an image in order to illustrate how “the universe develops to the
point where there are observers and these observers fix the past, including the
distant past long before any observers exist”:
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                         39


Wheeler argues that this type of “top-down, observer inclusive” approach
resolves the seeming paradox of the Anthropic Principle (which basically
argues that what we can observe about the universe is limited by the fact that
the universe we are observing is one which has enabled intelligent life capable
of observing it to evolve) and the seemingly bizarre unlikelihood of a universe
capable of supporting life:

   From a classical perspective it seems extraordinary that the laws of physics
   should have, at every choice, taken the path that resulted in a life-compatible
   universe. But if we are only now switching on the telescope and observing
   the fragment of the wave function that we live in, then it necessarily has
   to be one that supports life. We might be fixing a fragment that was very
   unlikely, statistically, to have arisen from repeated rolls of the dice. But then
   all the options are more or less unlikely.12

What I find problematic in these formulations is that, if we take the broadest
notion of observation, then there was no time without observers: the moment
our temporal reality emerged, “observations” take place, even if only by crystal
quartzes. What this means is that, at the proper quantum level, there is no big
rupture, no tremendous collapse of waves—collapses are going on all the time.
If every encounter/interaction counts as observation, does this not mean
that collapses are infinite since entities are processes of change which exist
only in interaction with others? For Rovelli, an entity is exposed to multiple
interactions, and in every interaction it “collapses” into a different determined
object (into a different eigenstate)—in itself, this object is just a mess of
quantum wave oscillations. The reversal implied by this claim is interesting: it
is not that an entity has a stable self-identity but appears to other entities in
different messy ways—on the contrary, an entity is in itself a messy complex of
superpositions which collapse in different ways through different interactions
. . . But, again, if collapse occurs in all encounters, even between two particles,
not just in observations in any narrower sense, then collapses happens all the
time continuously, trillions of trillions, more than particles—they are in no
way exceptional Events. So was Sabine Hossenfelder right when she wrote that
our universe is basically deterministic, with only infinitesimal margins of
uncertainty at the subatomic level which do not affect the larger-scale reality?

     The mystery of the role of observation in a quantum collapse is homologous
to the mystery of human communication: why is communication—a
dialogue—never just between two agents, why is a third agency, an impassive
observer (Lacan’s “big Other”), always necessary? This is why, I think, Rovelli is
wrong when he interprets any interaction between two particles or processes
as an act of observation in which each particle “observes” the other. The notion
of observer’s neutrality, of its distance from the observed process of interaction,
is irreducible. The lesson of quantum mechanics is not just that such a distance
is illusory since we, observers, are part of reality, so that our observation is
always an interaction, but something more subtle: “pure” observation is an
illusion, but what observation nonetheless bears witness to is that everything
that exists is not just interacting particles and processes—there is a gap, a void,
that sustains every interaction.
     From Marxism through language theories to quantum mechanics, the same
motif runs, that of the primacy of interaction over observation, of different
modes of inclusion of the observer into the observed process. Marxists and
language theorists like to emphasize that language is embedded in our practical
interactions and production, it is primarily not an instrument of talking about
external reality but a means of being engaged in social reality, even a field of
struggle, as Hamza wrote with regards to Lenin. Even the most neutral
statements—like the almost proverbial “There is a table in the corner of my
room”—are always embedded in specific practical contexts (they tell a stranger
where to look for my table, etc.). Quantum mechanics seems to bring this
tendency to its properly ontological extreme: there is no “objective reality”
since every act of observing (a part of) changes it. However, the first thing to
note is that advocates of observation-is-interaction themselves regularly
formulate their stance in statements which imply pure observation. When
Rovelli determines the basic level of reality as composed not of things but of
events, i.e., as a pure flux of becoming which cannot be attributed to any
external thing but consists only of particular interactions including our
observation, this statement is clearly not a moment of particular interaction
but an absolute universal observation. But a more important point is that
observation does not presuppose a neutral position outside the observed
reality: it is ultimately grounded in a gap in the observed process itself. To put
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                        41


it in speculative terms, not doing anything, not acting but just observing,
abstaining from interaction where interaction is expected, is itself the most
radical act, the most radical disturbance of the existing order. Abstaining is an
act not because we withdraw out of reality (there is nowhere to withdraw), but
because reality itself is structured around a void, its own impossibility, and by
way of not acting (and just observing) we temporarily place ourselves into that
void. Acting against is still participating in the order while not acting suspends
the very rules of the game. That’s why observation is needed for a collapse to
take place—collapse suspends the laws of quantum waves and superpositions.
   To repeat again the basic problem: if every interaction counts as observation
that causes a collapse, and if things exist only in their interrelationships, does
this not mean that all that exists are determined “collapsed” objects? Where is
there then any space for superpositions, for wave functions? Are entities with
which we don’t interact not-collapsed (in superpositions) for us, although they
are themselves collapsed? So can the same thing be collapsed from one
standpoint and not-collapsed from another standpoint? “The world is like a
collection of interrelated points of view. To speak of the world ‘seen from
outside’ makes no sense because there is no ‘outside’ to the world.”(109) But
interrelation means collapse, so is there nothing not-collapsed?
   We thus arrive at the so-called problem of Wigner’s Friend: no matter how
all-encompassing it is, an observation cannot include the observer itself as one
of its objects. Does this imply that collapses can also be superposed, that an
object/event X contains multiplicity of collapses, not only because it interacts
with multiple “observers” but because this interaction itself is observed by
multiple agents? To quote Rovelli again: “Each part of the world interacts with
a small part of all the variables, the value of which determines ‘the state of the
world with regard to that particular subsystem’.”(136) So, again, the world is
like a collection of interrelated points of view, each of which is in some sense
universal since it renders the entire world from a singular point of view.
   As Alenka Zupančič13 succinctly formulated it, reality in itself (independent
of our subjective interaction with it and perception of it) is not another
deeper reality (like the Kantian noumena as opposed to phenomenal reality),
it is the same as our reality minus the gap (of the real) which locates the subject
into it. One should thus not confuse the pre-ontological Real-in-itself implied
42                                 Quantum History


by quantum theory (a Real composed of quantum processes) with the
pre-ontological Real that we find in the films of David Lynch or Andrei
Tarkovsky (an impenetrable density which ultimately remains fantasmatic/
imaginary). The Lacanian question that arises here is how to avoid the Sartrean
duality between the inert in-itself and the void/negativity that is constitutive of
a subject, i.e., how such a subject can emerge in reality. In Chapter 9 (“What Is
a Picture?”) of his Seminar XI, Lacan notes apropos mimicry:

     We can grasp in effect something which, already in nature, appropriates the
     gaze to the function to which it may be put in the symbolic relation in man.
     . . . I set out from the fact that there is something that establishes a fracture,
     a bi-partition, a splitting of the being to which the being accommodates
     itself, even in the natural world.14

Zupančič is fully justified in pointing out that, at the epistemological level,
reality is accessible to us only because of this gap, of the distance that separates
a subject from “objective reality.” In this precise sense, the empty subject ($) is
correlated in a negative way to “objective reality” (analyzed by sciences) from
which the subject is constitutively excluded—if the subject disappears or if it
falls into reality (becoming one of the objects in it), “objective external reality”
goes with it. But how is this possible? How can a gap that enables us to see
reality as external appear in reality itself? Lacan’s answer is clear: the evolutionary
story of a gradual emergence of subjectivity out of natural biological processes
is not sufficient, there has to be a schism already in “natural” reality itself. I would
go further and advance the hypothesis that this is precisely why a true
materialism needs quantum mechanics. With its inclusion of observation
(which registers an event) into the ontological consistency of this event itself,
only quantum mechanics inscribes a radical schism into the very basic structure
of “natural” reality. But, again, what counts as an observation? It was
experimentally proven that collapse occurs already when a machine performs a
measurement, not only when some conscious observer looks at the result:

     What if we measure the atoms but don’t look at the result? In theory, the
     interference fringes should remain if we don’t know anything about the
     photons’ path. In reality, if we measure the energies of the remaining
     photons but keep that secret, the fringes don’t come back.15
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                         43


Relying on Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and quantum physics, Roger
Penrose takes the opposite path. His premise is that consciousness is not
computational, that it cannot be explained on the model of a computer, so we
have to refer to another more fundamental dimension to account for it.16
Gödel’s theorems are concerned with the limits of provability in formal
axiomatic theories. The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent
system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e.,
an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural
numbers. The second theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system
cannot demonstrate its own consistency.17 From a Hegelo-Lacanian standpoint,
a different solution imposes itself: what if, staying with Gödel, we posit that
there is no need to go beyond because consciousness is grounded in a deadlock
of computation, it is an effect of the computation stumbling upon a limit (a
limit beyond which there is nothing)? Is there not an intriguing resonance
between this idea and Heidegger’s point (in his analysis of our everyday use of
things in Sein und Zeit) that we become fully aware of tools only when they
malfunction? I use a hammer thoughtlessly, relying on long practice which has
habituated this object to me, but I become aware of it when, say, its weighted
“head” detaches itself from a long handle after I swing it too strongly?
   Penrose draws on the basic properties of quantum computing: bits (qubits)
of information can be in multiple states—for instance, in the “on” or “off ”
position—at the same time. These quantum states exist simultaneously—in
a “superposition”—before coalescing into a single, almost instantaneous,
calculation. Quantum coherence occurs when a huge number of things—say, a
whole system of electrons—act together in one quantum state. What has this to
do with our consciousness? Penrose refers here to Stuart Hameroff ’s idea that
quantum coherence happens in microtubules, protein structures inside the
brain’s neurons. Microtubules are tubular structures inside eukaryotic cells
(part of the cytoskeleton) that play a role in determining the cell’s shape, as well
as its movements, which includes cell division—separation of chromosomes
during mitosis. Hameroff suggests that microtubules are the quantum device
that Penrose had been looking for in his theory. In neurons, microtubules help
control the strength of synaptic connections, and their tube-like shape might
protect them from the surrounding noise of the larger neuron.
44                                 Quantum History


     Penrose believes that the microtubules’ symmetry and lattice structure “reek
of something quantum mechanical.”18
     There are three problems with this account. First, a large majority of
scientists reject Hameroff ’s idea of microtubules as quantum devices.19 Second,
although Hameroff ’s notion of microtubules is materialist (it describes what
goes on in our brain), his overall view is idealist (to put it bluntly, he thinks
consciousness is an immaterial spiritual substance), while “Penrose is an
atheist who calls himself ‘a very materialistic and physicalist kind of person,’
and he’s bothered by New Agers who’ve latched onto quantum theories about
non-locality and entanglement to prop up their paranormal beliefs.”20 However,
Penrose also seems to oscillate with regard to this point, claiming that proto-
consciousness is everywhere:

     An element of proto-consciousness takes place whenever a decision is made
     in the universe. I’m not talking about the brain. I’m talking about an object
     which is put into a superposition of two places. Say it’s a speck of dust that
     you put into two locations at once. Now, in a small fraction of a second, it
     will become one or the other. Which does it become? Well, that’s a choice.
     Is it a choice made by the universe? Does the speck of dust make this choice?
     Maybe it’s a free choice. I have no idea.21

In some passages, Penrose goes to the end of this road and draws the idealist
conclusion: “Somehow, our consciousness is the reason the universe is here.”22
Wigner was the one who formulated this conclusion openly: a measurement is
only accomplished when consciousness (a conscious being)—and not just a
machine—registers it. And in the dispute about the collapse of the wave
function, the extreme position is taken by Federico Faggin who postulates that
consciousness and free will are fundamental and non-algorithmic. Quantum
information emerges from them, and the quantum-classical physical world
emerges from quantum information. Consciousness is a quantum phenomenon
and digital computers, as classical, algorithmic systems, can never be conscious,
no matter their complexity.23 Faggin argues that reality consists of “an
undivided energy that has the desire and the capacity to experience and know
itself,” an energy that he calls “One.” One, according to Faggin, exists in a “vaster
reality” beyond the reality we experience, where there are many Ones:
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                        45


   So, the entities are the conscious fields, and they shape symbols within their
   own fields to communicate with other fields—other entities. The crucial
   difference with contemporary physics is that these fields have an inner
   semantic and conscious experience, just like we do. The symbols have
   meaning that are understood by the conscious fields. . . . Matter is nothing
   more than the information that conscious entities use to communicate with
   each other to know themselves.24

Taken in its abstract form, this position is just a new version of Leibniz’s
monadology—so where does quantum physics enter in? Faggin’s idea is that
the collapse of superpositions into a single reality is a conscious free act of the
One—the One can be any entity to/in which superpositions happen, even the
tiniest subparticles, since all that exists are such Ones with consciousness and
free will. The One is aware of all the choices embodied in superpositions and
then freely chooses one of them which becomes part of our reality . . . I of
course totally reject this solution. Superpositions collapse in a contingent way,
but their collapse follows the laws of probability. Collapse is contingent, but
not the result of a free act: freed decision is not a contingent act, it is an act
determined by a decision. And if we begin with postulating consciousness and
free will to account for quantum phenomena, we proceed like bad theologians
postulating an omnipotent free god to explain nature and history, i.e., explaining
empirical enigmas and mysteries by evoking an even greater mystery.
   Here we find ourselves at the opposite extreme to Rovelli, for whom
“observation” which collapses a quantum superposition has nothing to do with
consciousness since it occurs in any material interaction of different particles.
When two electrons interact in such a way that an information passes between
the two, an observation takes place, although the amount of information is here
minimal—all that an electron can “swallow” is just a simple qubit (like “up” or
“down”), while humans constantly process enormous amount of information.
For us, “observation” implies a minimum of passivity (“I am not doing anything,
I am just observing it”), while in quantum physics every observation already is
an interaction that interferes with the observed object or process.
   Of special interest here are attempts to define the modes of cognition which
do not involve any conscious self-awareness, not even the one that is sometimes
46                              Quantum History


attributed to highly developed animals. In an overview of the existing literature,
Michael Marder convincingly argues that “plants are res cogitantes extendentes”:
“plants are constantly extending their cognition through the active extension
of their bodies, and, with it, their functional cognitive apparatuses. And
beyond that, plants also actively extend their cognitive process to the
environment they are constantly engaged with and which houses a wide array
of their biochemical substances.”25 Such an anti-Cartesian approach (rejecting
the ontological distinction between res cogitans and res extensa) has nothing
whatsoever to do with any New Age vitalist obscurantism—it remains firmly
in the space of scientific materialism.




                     The Limit of Relationality

The interactive concept of observation advanced by Rovelli and others, which
marks out what has become known as relational quantum mechanics (RQM),
struggles to account for the basic quantum mechanical fact that, in the case of
entangled particles, if A measures the spin of one of the particles, he can know
what the spin of the other particle is without even waiting for a message from
B who will measure this spin. Or, more modestly, he can know what any other
observer who will measure the spin of the other particle will see.
     The price Matteo Smerlak and Rovelli are ready to pay for their relational
view26 is that they reject the predominant view according to which the
violations of Bell’s theorem provide a proof of non-locality, and claim that
their version of RQM enables us to save locality: “it is not necessary to abandon
locality in order to account for EPR correlations.27 From the relational
perspective, the apparent ‘quantum non-locality’ is a mistaken illusion caused
by the error of disregarding the quantum nature of all physical systems.” First,
what is locality? “We call locality the principle demanding that two spatially
separated events cannot have instantaneous mutual influence. We will argue
that this is not contradicted by EPR type correlations, if we take the relational
perspective on quantum mechanics.” The basic axiom of RQM is that physical
reality is
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                       47


   formed by the individual quantum events (facts) through which interacting
   systems (objects) affect one another. Quantum events are therefore assumed
   to exist only in interactions and (this is the central point) the character of
   each quantum event is only relative to the system involved in the interaction.
   . . . different observers can give different accounts of the actuality of the
   same physical property. This fact implies that the occurrence of an event
   is not something absolutely real or not, but it is only real in relation to
   a specific observer. Notice that, in this context, an observer can be any
   physical system. . . . The preferred Copenhagen observer is relativized into
   the multiplicity of observers, formed by all possible physical systems, and
   therefore it no longer escapes the laws of quantum mechanics.

In the EPR situation, we have precisely such a case: each of the two entangled
particles is measured by a separate observer (A and B), so that

   A and B can be considered two distinct observers, both making
   measurements on α and β. The comparison of the results of their
   measurements . . . cannot be instantaneous, that is, it requires A and B to be
   in causal contact. More importantly, with respect to A, B is to be considered
   as a normal quantum system (and, of course, with respect to B, A is a normal
   quantum system). . . . this does not mean that B and A cannot communicate
   their experience. In fact, in either account the possibility of communicating
   experiences exists and in either account consistency is ensured.
   Contradiction emerges only if, against the main stipulation of RQM, we
   insist on believing that there is an absolute, external account of the state of
   affairs in the world, obtained by juxtaposing actualities relative to different
   observers.

In this precise sense Smerlak and Rovelli distance themselves from Einstein
while pointing out that “Einstein’s original motivation with EPR was not to
question locality, but rather to question the completeness of QM, on the basis
of a firm confidence in locality”:

   RQM is complete in the sense of exhausting everything that can be said
   about nature. However, in a sense RQM can be interpreted as the discovery
   of the incompleteness of the description of reality that any single observer
48                                Quantum History


     can give: A can measure the pointer variable of B, but the set of the events
     as described by B is irreducibly distinct from the set of events as described
     by A. In this particular sense, RQM can be said to show the “incompleteness”
     of single-observer Copenhagen QM. Einstein’s intuition that the EPR
     correlations reveal something deeply missing in Copenhagen quantum
     mechanics can thus be understood as being correct: the incompleteness
     of Copenhagen QM is the disregard of the quantum properties of all
     observers, which leads to paradoxes as the apparent violation of locality
     exposed by EPR.

I tend to agree with Lee Smolin when he claims that “time is the least illusional
thing we know about,”28 in contrast to space which is “the final illusion,” and
when he draws this conclusion from the recent experiments demonstrating a
faster-than-light contact between particles far away from each other:

     Of all the strange aspects of quantum physics so far discovered, the strangest
     of all has to be the shocking discovery that the principle of relativistic
     causality is violated by quantum phenomena. Roughly speaking, if two
     particles interact and then separate, flying far apart from each other, they
     nonetheless may continue to share properties of a strange kind, that may be
     ascribed to the pair, without each of the individuals having themselves any
     definite properties. We say the two particles are “entangled.”29

It is difficult to avoid here the term “knowledge in the real” coined by Lacan: as
we have already seen,30 if there are two entangled particles and we measure the
spin of one of them, we can simply (or not so simply) claim that our
measurement/observation (they are not the same) changes its behaviour,
making it “collapse” into a definite value; simultaneously, the other particle also
“collapses” and changes its behaviour. The well-known problem is: we did not
interact in any way with the second particle, so how did the second particle
knew that the first one was measured/observed and accordingly changed its
behaviour? As we have already seen,31 there seem to be only two explanations:
instant (faster than light) communication between the two entangled particles
or the moving of information backwards in time (the first particle goes back in
time and somehow lets the second particle know what will happen to it in the
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                        49


near future). Can the notion of gravity be of some help here?
   What we should introduce here is a minimal gap between things in their
immediate brute proto-reality and the registration of this reality in some
medium (of the big Other): the second is in a delay with regard to the first.
Many things go on before registration: in this shadowy space, “normal” laws of
nature are continuously suspended—how? Imagine that you have to take a
flight on day x to pick up a fortune the next day, but do not have the money to
buy the ticket; but then you discover that the accounting system of the airline
is such that if you wire the ticket payment within twenty-four hours of arrival
at your destination, no one will ever know it was not paid prior to departure.
In a homologous way,

   the energy a particle has can wildly fluctuate so long as this fluctuation is
   over a short enough time scale. So, just as the accounting system of the
   airline “allows” you to “borrow” the money for a plane ticket provided you
   pay it back quickly enough, quantum mechanics allows a particle to
   “borrow” energy so long it can relinquish it within a time frame determined
   by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. . . . But quantum mechanics forces us
   to take the analogy one important step further. Imagine someone who is a
   compulsive borrower and goes from friend to friend asking for money. . . .
   Borrow and return, borrow and return—over and over again with unflagging
   intensity he takes in money only to give it back in short order. . . . A similar
   frantic shifting back and forth of energy and momentum is occurring
   perpetually in the universe of microscopic distance and time intervals.32

The problem that arises here for a Hegelian like me is: can we grasp this paradox
of existing by way of borrowing from the future in the categories of Hegel’s
logic? Does this paradox not imply a notion of temporality—a present
“borrowing” from the future to exist—for which there is no place in Hegel? I
think the situation is nonetheless more ambiguous. Is not the Hegelian dialectical
process not structured precisely like a constant borrowing from the future, the
“future” being the Absolute itself which is presupposed by existing in an In-itself
outside of our reach? And what comes at the end, in “absolute knowing,” is not
that we finally no longer borrow from the future; what we realize is that the
process has no external Absolute as it gradually approaches, that the truth of the
50                                 Quantum History


process resides in the process itself which turns around a void. This is why, as
Lenin saw it, what we get at the end of Hegel’s Logic is not the description of the
Absolute as it “really is” but just the recapitulation of the process itself that led to
this point. And, as Lacanians, should we not also take note how, to characterize
the eternal circular movement of the absolute Idea, Hegel uses the term
“enjoyment”? “The eternal Idea, in full fruition of its essence, eternally sets itself
to work, engenders and enjoys itself as absolute spirit.”33
     Problematic as this parallel may be, one thing is clear here: a language in
which we dwell works precisely in this way, through a permanent borrowing
from the future. When we speak, we never fully know what we mean by what
we are saying, we implicitly count on a meaning that is to come but is never
fully here-and-now—only such a borrowing from the future allows us
to experience what we are saying now as meaningful. A fully actualized
meaning equals meaninglessness. (In psychoanalysis, the same phenomenon
is called “transference”: a patient’s “transference” on the analyst means that he
presupposes the analyst already knows the meaning of his symptoms, while
this meaning is effectively constructed in the analytic process.)
     I see a problem for the reading of quantum mechanics through the categories
of Hegel’s thought at another level. Recall the already mentioned experiments
which demonstrate that two particles (like two entangled photons) can interact
faster than the speed of light: the particles are interrelated in such a way
that, if I give to the first particle a spin up, the other particle will instantly
acquire a spin down, even if the particles are far far away from each other.
Instead of getting lost in speculations about how the two particles can interact
faster than light at such great distance, would it not be more productive to
posit that there is another dimension of space in which the two particles are
in direct contact with each other? And I don’t see in Hegel’s notion of space
any signs that he considers the possibility of different dimensions of space
(and/or time).
     This is how, even in an empty region of space, a particle emerges out of
Nothing, “borrowing” its energy from the future and paying for it (with its
annihilation) before the system notices this borrowing. The whole network can
function like this, in a rhythm of borrowing and annihilation, one borrowing
from the other, displacing the debt onto the other, postponing the payment of
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                        51


the debt—uncannily as if the whole sub-particle domain are Wall Street traders
playing with futures. What this presupposes is, again, a minimal gap between
things in their immediate brute reality and the registration of this reality in
some medium (of the big Other): one can cheat insofar as the second is delayed
with regard to the first. The theological implications of this gap between the
virtual proto-reality and the fully-constituted one are of special interest.
Insofar as “god” is the agent who creates things by way of observing them, the
quantum indeterminacy compels us to posit a god who is omnipotent, but not
omniscient:

   If God collapses the wave functions of large things to reality by His
   observation, quantum experiments indicate that He is not observing the
   small.34

The ontological cheating with virtual particles (an electron can create a proton
and thereby violate the principle of constant energy, on condition that it
reabsorbs it before its environs “take note” of the discrepancy) is a way to cheat
god himself, the ultimate agency of taking note of everything that goes on.
This is the ultimate atheist lesson of quantum physics: even god himself doesn’t
control quantum processes. Einstein was right when he famously claimed that
“God doesn’t cheat”—what he forgot to add is that god himself can be cheated.
Insofar as the materialist thesis is that “god is unconscious” (god doesn’t
know), quantum physics effectively is materialist: there are microprocesses
(quantum oscillations) which are not registered by the god-system. And
insofar as God is one of the names of the big Other, we can see in what sense
one cannot simply get rid of god (big Other) and develop an ontology without
big Other: god is an illusion, but a necessary one.35 And the same holds at the
social and political level—as Alenka Zupančič pointed out, the basic axiom of
our era of conspiracy theories (which rely on the premise that we are all the
time deceived by some hidden masters who really pull the strings of our social
life) is: “I am deceived, therefore I am.” The materialist answer to this axiom is:
no, it is the big Other which is deceived.
   If we universalize relationality and define every part of reality as depending
on an observer (so that the same part of reality not only appears different but
is different for different observers), do we not get stuck in a rather flat global
52                                Quantum History


view akin to the first feature of dialectical materialism formulated by Stalin:
every entity is caught in a complex network of relations, things do not exist
alone in separation from each other . . . Or, to complicate things further: when
A and B interact, are they both not at the same time observers of the other and
observed by the other? So why do we even need an external observer that
registers the interaction? Do the two interacting particles not already observe
each other?
     A naïve but significant philosophical counterpoint arises here: if everything
is relative, if it is what it is only relationally, with regard to an observer, does
this entire network not float in the air? In order not to collapse into itself, does
this network not need to rely on some form of Absolute? The answer is: yes,
but this Absolute is not some reality-in-itself beyond all observations. It can
only be a negative foundation: the limit itself, a limit beyond which there is
nothing. In the same way as, in structuralism, differentiality can only function
through a pure difference, in quantum relationality the fact that every entity is
grounded in being-observed implies that not-everything can be observed, but
this unobservable is not an external not-observed positive reality, it is the limit
of observation itself.
     For Rovelli, “RQM is realist about the existence of quantum entities, even
though it is antirealist about the wave function”: wave function superpositions
are just an instrument for calculating probabilities as they appear to an
observer of a quantum entity, not part of the observed reality . . . Here we
stumble upon the basic philosophical question: when we claim that a theory
should fit reality, what do we mean by reality? When asked about an underlying
quantum world, Bohr allegedly answered: “There is no quantum world. There
is only an abstract quantum physical description. It is wrong to think that the
task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say
about Nature.”36 So all we are effectively dealing with are parts of our everyday
reality: numbers on the screen of a measuring apparatus, etc. But is such a view
not all too easy? How to combine it with Bohr’s claim that “everything we call
real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real”? It is difficult to avoid
the question: why do the predictions of quantum mechanics hold up, when
tested—and quantum mechanics is the most successfully tested theory in the
history of science? Wave superpositions are not just possibilities: the point of
                       Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                       53


quantum mechanics is that possibilities have as such an actuality and influence
the outcome—in some cases, the only way to account for a measurement is
to assume that a particle took all possible superposed paths. Or, as Nikki
Weststeijn put it in a concise way:

   In RQM the wave function is understood as a book-keeping device that
   tracks what will happen upon the next interaction. It encodes any previous
   interaction that A has had with system S and allows A to predict the state of
   S with respect to A in the future.37

It is thus “a bookkeeping device instead of a representation of a real physical
quality.” However, is it necessary for RQM that the wave function does not
represent any real physical quantity? “If we say that the wave function does
not represent a real physical quantity, the question then remains what the
underlying physical quantity is that in some way gives rise to the wave
function.” In short, “in order to give a coherent interpretation, RQM should
take the wave function to represent a real physical quantity, albeit a relative
quantity.”38
   The collapse of superpositions effectuated by a measurement asserts the
duality of quantum reality and ordinary reality. Do all the paradoxes displayed
by the measurement of quantum processes not impose a rather obvious
conclusion: beyond/beneath our ordinary spatio-temporal reality there is not
a timeless spiritual domain but another level of reality where the laws of our
spatio-temporal reality do not apply (where a particle can take many paths
simultaneously, where two entangled particles can be in contact instantaneously,
faster than the speed of light, etc.)? This duality is not complementary (in the
traditional sense of the term) since it concerns two totally incompatible levels
of reality—the two levels are related like the two dimensions of a parallax.
Here Lacan’s logic of non-all can be of some use: our ordinary reality forms
an All grounded in an exception (the observer which causes the collapse of
superpositions), while the quantum reality requires no exception, yet it is for
that very reason not-all, and the impossibility that makes it non-all pushes the
network of superpositions towards collapse. So what if, in order to grasp this
duality, we use Lacan’s difference between the two forms of assertion: an X
exists or there is (something of) X (il y a de . . .)? Lacan’s examples: “la Femme
54                                Quantum History


n’existe pas” (the Woman doesn’t exist) and “il n’y a pas de grand Autre” (there
is no big Other). The second negation is stronger: although the Woman doesn’t
exist, there is (something of) the women . . . Similarly, a single reality that arises
through the collapse of a wave’s superpositions exists while there are
superpositions which do not properly exist.
                                      *
This basic ontological question of the status of quantum waves is something
that today’s technological-scientific practice itself confronts us with. On
December 8, 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum chip:

     Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a
     computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest
     supercomputers 1025 or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it out,
     it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling number
     exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the
     universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs
     in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse,
     a prediction first made by David Deutsch.39

However, we should avoid the conclusion that we live in a multiverse:
multiverse means multiple realities which are like our own reality, and in this
way we obliterate the gap that separates our “collapsed” reality from the reality
of quantum oscillations. More precisely, what the notion of multiverse fails
to encompass is the dimension clearly noted by Rovelli’s pluralistic and
perspectivalist view of quantum mechanics, the dimension best rendered by
the following quite striking quotation:

     if we want to get a true idea of what a point of space-time is like we should
     look outward at the universe . . . The complete notion of a point of space-
     time in fact consists of the appearance of the entire universe as seen from
     that point.40

Does Rovelli not make here a point homologous to that of Lacan? “The picture
is in my eye, but me, I am in the picture.”41 The world is disclosed to the
singularity of my eye, but I am in the world. The mutual determination between
a subsystem of the universe and the universe itself is not perfectly symmetrical:
                        Why Quantum Mechanics Needs Hegel                            55


it is true that the nature of such a local subsystem (“space-time point”) depends
on the way it interacts with, or “reflects”, the universe from its particular
perspective (and this seems a partial concession to monism), but in RQM
there is no Leibnizian “monad of the monads” because the cosmos can only be
described from some local physical system.” The problem with priority monism
is that it concentrates exclusively on the dependence of the part from the
whole, neglecting completely the converse type of dependence.”42 This converse
dependence is crucial: part is a part of all which is itself included in its parts . . .
Along these lines, I follow R. Muciño, E. Okon and D. Sudarsky’s essay
“Assessing Relational Quantum Mechanics”43 which deals with the general
ambiguity problem that affects standard quantum theory when deprived of
special roles for measuring devices or observers:

   within RQM, the breakdown of unitarity is not brought about by mysterious
   quantum jumps. Instead, it is a consequence of the fact that it is impossible
   to give a full description of an interaction in which one is involved.

This is a truly ingenious solution: the wave collapse happens because of the
impossibility of a full description that would include the observer measuring a
quantum state. So, in a properly-dialectical tension, waves collapse locally
because they cannot collapse globally.

      Noncommutativity in
     the symbolic and in the
         (quantum) real


From a philosophical standpoint, the key enigma of quantum mechanics
concerns the exact ontological status of quantum waves. The most
straightforward solution eradicates the problem, but at much too high a price;
this is the Many Worlds Interpretation which doesn’t interpret the ψ wave as a
probability but “sees it instead as a real entity, effectively describing the world
as it is.”1 In the collapse of a wave function, all probabilities are realized, each
in its own world—with regard to Schrödinger’s cat, in one world, the cat is
alive, in another world, the cat is dead. At the opposite end, we have Rovelli’s
epistemic approach for which “ψ” is a “calculation tool”, like a weather forecast
or racing odds:

   Real events in the world happen in a probabilistic way, and the quantity ψ is
   our way of calculating the probability of their occurring. Interpretations of
   the theory that do not take the ψ waves so seriously are called “epistemic”,
   because they interpret ψ only as a summary of our knowledge of what
   happens.
                                                                               (58)

Rovelli goes here a step further: probabilism does not just signal the limitations
of our knowledge, but reality is in itself under-determined. The discovery of
quantum theory

                                                                                 57
58                                Quantum History


     is the discovery that the properties of any entity are nothing other than
     the way in which that entity influences others. It exists only through its
     interactions. Quantum theory is the theory of how things influence each
     other. And this is the best description of nature that we have.
                                                                               (69)

We can already guess what awaits us at the end of this road: Nagarjuna’s
Mahayana Buddhist ontology (121–31). If all reality is perspectival, if all
properties of an entity arise out of its interaction with other entities, and if all
this holds for the entirety of reality which is not composed of things that
interact but of ephemeral events that momentarily pop up and disappear, then
there is also no substantial reality that underlies this ephemeral world of
phenomena—then the only Absolute, the only X beneath the dance of events,
is the Void (sunyata), and this includes also the Self which has no substantial
content outside its interactions with others and external reality. I think such a
notion of the Void obfuscates the key tension between the global ontological
Void which is all-encompassing and the Void of a Self which is point-like,
puncturing, violently negating all external reality. To paraphrase Hegel, it is
crucial to conceive the Void not just as Substance but also as Subject.
     One can formulate this key point also in the terms of the distinction between
“nothing” and “less than nothing”: “nothing” is the all-encompassing Void
(sunyata) about which Buddhism speaks, while “less than nothing” as the
puncturing point of absolute contradiction is not the first differentiation in the
primordial Void and in this sense the first step towards the multiplicity that
characterizes our reality. “Less than nothing” comes (logically) before the
nothing of the primordial Void, it is the absolute contradiction which is
already primordially repressed (to use this Freudian term) in every pacifying
experience of the Void. In short, the paradox resides in the fact that one already
has to add something to the “less than nothing” to arrive at the “nothing” . . .2
But my basic reproach to Rovelli concerns his reduction of the wave function
to a mere probabilistic calculation:

     The ψ wave is the probabilistic calculation of where and how an event
     relative to us might occur. The wave as well is therefore a perspectival
     quantity. An object does not have one ψ wave, it has one with respect to
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real         59


   every other object with which it interacts. Events that take place in relation
   to one thing do not influence the probability of events that occur in relation
   to others. The “quantum state” ψ is always a relative state.
                                                                             (74)

Rovelli explains further his notion of ψ wave apropos Schrödinger’s famous
thought experiment about a cat in a box. In Rovelli’s version, the subject is shut
in a box and a quantum mechanism controls the release of a sleeping drug.
Rovelli points out that

   For you the drug was delivered, or it was not delivered. There are no doubts.
   As far as you are concerned, you are asleep or you are awake. You are
   certainly not both at once. I, on the other hand, am outside the box and do
   not interact either with the bottle of sleeping draught or with you. Later on
   I can observe interference phenomena between you-awake and you-asleep:
   phenomena that would not have been produced if I had seen you asleep, or
   if I had seen you awake. In this sense, for me you are neither asleep nor
   awake. This is what it means to say that you are “in a superposition of
   sleeping and waking.”
                                                                             (71)

Rovelli then applies this insight to Anton Zeilinger’s famous experiment which
demonstrated that two entangled particles can exchange information faster
than the speed of light (i.e, for all practical purposes instantaneously). (For
this experiment, Zeilinger shared with two others the 2022 Nobel prize for
physics.) Rovelli’s counter-argument is that, since there is no universal
simultaneity, the spin of each of the two entangled particles (which are at a
large distance from each other) cannot be measured at the same instant: a
minimum of time has to lapse for the information about the spin of the particle
A to reach the observer who measured the spin of the particle B:

   Only God can see the two places at the same moment—but God, if She
   exists, does not tell us what She sees. What She sees is irrelevant to reality.
   We cannot rely upon the existence of something that only God can see. . . .
   We can compare the two measurements, in Beijing and Vienna, but the
   comparison requires an exchange of signals: the two laboratories can send
60                                Quantum History


     each other emails or talk on the phone. An email takes time, as does a voice
     on the phone: nothing travels instantaneously, and an exchange of signals is
     an interaction, where new elements of reality come about.
                                                                            (84, 85)

Rovelli relies here on special relativity theory which implies that there is no
global simultaneity, no NOW that encompasses the entire universe. If you
observe, through a telescope, a person on a planet four light years from the
Earth, what you see is what she was doing four years ago on that planet. So can
you say that she is “now” doing what you, in your now, observe her doing
through your telescope? No, because four years after you have seen her through
the telescope, in her time, “she might already have returned to Earth and could
be ten terrestrial years in the future (measured by the Earthly time).”(39) So
between my past—the events that happened before what I can witness (in my)
now—and my future—the events that will happen after my now—“there is an
interval that is neither past nor future, and still has a duration. It is an expanded
present (15 minutes on Mars, millions of years in the Andromeda galaxy . . .).”
     Does this not imply that there is nevertheless an aspect of time that survives
the demolition of the Newtonian theory of time? And the same holds for
space—Newton’s notion of empty space as a neutral container independent of
what it contains is not a blind alley in our understanding of space but a big step
forwards. This notion is, of course, ultimately wrong, space is not independent
of what it contains, of what is “in it”; however, this notion can only emerge if
spacetime itself is structured around a hole, a gap in its very core.
     The world is nothing but change; it is not a collection of things, it is a
collection of events, and these events are “in a where but also in a when. They
are spatially but also temporarily delimited: they are events.”(87) The only
limitation is that “we cannot arrange the universe like a single orderly sequence
of times” (99): “In the world, there is change, there is a temporal structure
of relations between events that is anything but illusory. It is not a global
happening. It is a local and complex one which is not amenable to being
described in terms of a single global order.”(100)
     However, the point of Zeilinger’s experiment is the status of knowledge: if
two particles are entangled, then if I give a specific contingent spin to a particle
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real          61


A, I know the spin of B automatically, without any additional measurement.
(Plus what happens if, while observing both entangled particles, I then in a
contingent way change the spin of one of them again? Will the spin of the
other also change accordingly?)

   Entanglement is therefore far from being a rare phenomenon that occurs
   only in particular situations: it is what happens generically in an interaction,
   when this interaction is considered in relation to a system external to it.
   From an external perspective, any manifestation of one object to another,
   which is to say any property, is a correlation; it is an entanglement between
   an object and another.
                                                                              (88)

I think Rovelli succumbs here (as in the case of observation) to an all too easy
generalization; whenever an interaction between two elements is considered
from an external perspective, the two are entangled. I also think Rovelli
reduces superpositions too quickly to an external observer, and thereby to
probabilities: for him, in Schrödinger’s thought experiment the cat is in two
superposed states for me (who doesn’t see what went on in the box), while the
cat itself is either alive or dead, there is no superposition there.
   On a more general level, why should we not endorse what in our space
appears as faster than light contact if space is relativized? It’s not that the two
entangled particles interact faster than light in the same space as ours, it is
that they move in a different mode of space. So, as I already pointed out in
Chapter 1, do all paradoxes displayed by the measurement of quantum
processes not impose a rather obvious conclusion: beyond/beneath our
ordinary spatio-temporal reality there is (not a timeless spiritual domain but)
another level of reality where the laws of our spatio-temporal reality do not
apply (where a particle can take many paths simultaneously, where two
entangled particles can be in contact instantaneously, faster than the speed of
light, etc.)? And, to make an even riskier step further, do we not encounter
something homologous in Walter Benjamin’s distinction between historicist
evolutionism and the properly historical dialectic in suspense? The temptation
is to simply invert the standard relationship between particles and waves:
waves do not connect (pre-existing) particles, particles emerge when two
62                                Quantum History


(or more) waves interact, cross each other’s path. But this temptation is to be
resisted: waves get “reified” in particles because waves are in themselves
ontologically fragile, structured around a lack.
     To summarise my basic stance, if the “true reality” of fields and waves is out
of time and space, then time and space are in some basic sense illusory.
However, isn’t the underlying scheme of basic reality and illusory appearances
false in the same way that its opposite, the gradual progress towards higher
forms? What pushes this pre-ontological quantum space towards collapses
and/or towards our common reality must be some immanent impossibility, a
“barred One,” or some “boundary” (beyond which there is nothing—a
boundary which coincides with its Beyond, i.e., which is itself inaccessible) in
the basic quantum space itself.3
     In the Many Words interpretation, the ontological gap between quantum
waves and our ordinary reality disappears: there are only quantum waves with
all their superposed versions actualized. Based on this insight, Sean Carroll
postulated that from an (impossible) objective view, we could give a full
deterministic description of reality—the problem is only that we would not
know to which of the multiple worlds we belong, i.e., where we (the observer)
were located in this multitude of worlds. Is this not the problem with the
Cartesian cogito? The subject reduced to a pure observer has no place in
mechanically-determined external reality, and it exists as subject only if it has
no place in it. Lacan knew this when he wrote that modern science is based on
the foreclosure of the subject . . . How to resolve this paradox? Again, we
should posit that the objective view which would give a full deterministic
description of reality is not only inaccessible to us because of our finitude
(because we are part of reality), but—much more radically—because reality is
in itself not all, because it doesn’t exist as a totality with no immanent barrier.
     Rovelli knows this, which is why he defines reality as a multiplicity of worlds
each of which is rooted in the point-of-view of a particular observer—there is
no “independent” reality. Rovelli is also right to reject the idea that this
multiplicity implies a version of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
oscillations; however, he seems to get caught in the traditional philosophical
paradox when he “argues that it is impossible for a system to have information
about itself because it requires it to stand in a particular correlation to itself
             Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real            63


and this is not possible. It is not a new idea that quantum mechanics cannot
describe the observers.”(102) So if “in RQM it does not make sense to claim
that the whole universe is in a state of entanglement because, by being part of
it, we cannot interact with it by definition,”(104) do we not here stumble upon
the old Russell’s paradox (is a set a part of itself?) in a new guise? We should
reply that a set which contains itself is not an exception but universal: every
singularity is a hologram which contains itself as its element, and it is in this
sense that it stands “in a particular correlation to itself ” since it contains itself
not in a general sense but in a singular sense. What is effectively impossible is
to have a whole of reality containing itself, but this is impossible precisely
because the hologram-structure of reality makes reality as a Whole impossible—
not in the simple sense of irreducible multiplicity but in the more precise sense:
every singularity already reflects all of reality in its singular way, so there is no
all-encompassing Whole because Wholes are themselves multiplied.
   Or, to put it in the terms of the liar’s paradox, if my statement “I am always
lying” is true, then this statement itself is a lie since it implies that I am not
always lying, etc. Lacan offers a solution here, distinguishing between the
content of an enunciation and the subjective stance of enunciation implied
by it: “I am always lying” can correctly render my experience of my entire
existence as inauthentic, as a fake. However, the opposite also holds: the
statement “I know I am a piece of shit” can in itself be literally true but false at
the level of the subjective stance it pretends to render since it implies that, by
saying it, I somehow demonstrate that I am NOT fully “a piece of shit,” that I
am honest about myself . . . But have these psychological finesses anything to
do with the quantum universe?
   If, as Rovelli repeatedly claims, there is no object, no element of reality,
which is not observed, if objects exist only in relation to an observer, as relative
to that observer, then the fact that “it does not make sense to claim that the
whole universe is in a state of entanglement” means that one should abandon
the very notion of the “whole universe.” This doesn’t imply that there is something
outside the universe—it’s just that the universe cannot be totalized since to
do this an external observer is needed. The non-totalizability of the universe
thus implies a negative limit (boundary), a limit outside which there is
nothing. So I as a part of the universe can claim that there is nothing in the
64                                 Quantum History


universe that is not entangled—and that, located at this boundary, I am this
nothing. I cannot be just a part of the universe: the whole world “collapses” in
me as an observer, i.e., in one of its parts.
     To put it in yet another way, when relational quantum mechanics posits that
quantum events exist only in interactions and that the character of each
quantum event is only relative to the system involved in the interaction, so that
different observers can give different accounts of the actuality of the same
physical property, i.e., when it claims that the occurrence of an event is not
something absolutely real or not, but it is only real in relation to a specific
observer, are these and similar claims universally true (true independently of
any observer) or are they also valid only in relation to a specific (human)
observer? The only way to assert their universal validity without presupposing
a global external observer is to base such universal claims on an immanent
limitation or boundary of reality itself.
     The complications that arise when we try to fully understand Zeilinger’s
experiment demonstrate what makes quantum mechanics so provocative:
even what appears a modest experiment displays, upon closer analysis, radical
philosophical implications. To complicate things even further, let’s analyze
another experiment performed by Zeilinger for Rovelli in more detail. A weak
laser beam made up of a small number of photons is split into two parts,
creating two separate paths—one, let’s say, on the “right,” and the other one on
the “left.” (One should note that Rovelli mentions this experiment and not the
one for which Zeilinger with two others got the Nobel prize for 2022: the
other experiment was meant to demonstrate the instant (faster than light)
communication between two entangled particles, and Rovelli disagrees with
this reading of the experiment—for him there is no communication faster
than the speed of light.) The two paths are reunited before becoming separated
again and ending up in two detectors: one let’s say “up” and the other “down”:


     What I saw is this: if I blocked either one of the two paths (left or right) with
     my hand, half of the photons ended up in the down detector and half ended
     up in the up one. But if I left both paths open, free of any impediment, all of
     the photons ended up in the lower detector: none in the one above it. . . .
     There is something very peculiar going on. If half of the photons arrive at
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real           65


   the up detector when one path is free, it would seem reasonable to expect
   that half of the photons should also arrive above when both paths are free.
   But this is not the case. In fact, none do. How, by blocking one path, can
   my hand cause the photons traveling on the other path to go to the upper
   detector?4
                                                                               (45)

The strangeness of the situation resides in the fact that “it seems that you need
only to observe for what is happening to change! Note the absurdity: if I don’t
look for where the photon passes, it always finishes below. But if I look at
where it passes, it can end up above. The astonishing thing is that a photon can
end up above even if I haven’t seen it. That is to say, the photon changes
trajectory due to the fact that I was waiting for it at the gate, on the side where
it hasn’t passed. Even if I haven’t actually seen it!”(47)
   What makes the situation strange is that it (not quite symmetrically, but
nonetheless) up-ends the common idea of quantum mechanics according to
which, if a process is unobserved it remains in a state of superposition, while
observation reduces this multiplicity and causes its “collapse” into one version
which is part of our ordinary reality. Here, however, if the first part of the
process is unobstructed, the second part finishes with all particles in one exit,
and if the first part is obstructed, the second part finishes with particles equally
distributed between the two exits. It is not simply that observation affects the
observed object; the mystery resides in the fact that just observing (one exit of
the two—the one through which NOTHING passes) tells us that all particles
passed through the other exit. And there is a further mystery: how did the
particles somehow know that one of the exits is observed and avoided it?
   For Rovelli, the answer is provided by the concept of noncommutativity. In
a quantum world, to multiply the position by the velocity is different from
multiplying the velocity by the position: the order counts. Why? Because of
the uncertainty principle. “The uncertainty principle does not mean that we
cannot measure the position of a particle with great precision and then its
speed very precisely as well. We can. But after the second measurement, the
position will no longer be the same: measuring the speed loses information
on the position, so that if we measure it again, we will find it changed.”(93)
66                              Quantum History


“This tells us precisely about the importance of order: ‘first X and then P’ is
different from ‘first P and then X’. How different? By an amount that depends
on Planck’s constant: the scale of quantum phenomena.”(94) X and P are thus
noncommutative variables:

     “Noncommutative” means: such that their order cannot be changed freely.
                                                                             (94)

This brings us back to Zeilinger’s photons. The experiment was structured so
that the behaviour of each photon could be described by two variables: X
(right/left) and P (up/down). Like the position and speed of a particle according
to the uncertainty principle, these two variables are non-commutative; they
cannot be determined at the same time. “This is the reason why, if we close
one of the paths determining the first variable (‘right’ or ‘left’), the second is
undetermined: the photons go randomly ‘up’ or ‘down’. Vice versa, in order for
the second variable to be determined, for the photons to all go ‘down’, it is
necessary that the first variable should not be determined; that is, that the
photons must pass via both paths ‘right’ and ‘left’. The entire phenomenon
follows from the equation which says that these two variables ‘do not commute’
(are noncommutative), and hence cannot be determined together.”(95)
     But are we here really dealing with the impossibility of measuring two
properties (like position and speed of a particle) simultaneously? Do we not
get the case of measuring two properties of a photon (left/right plus up/down)
one after the other? So I would still like to get an explanation of how the very
indetermination of the first part (no path is blocked) causes the determination
of the second part (all photons go down)—is it not as if less order in the first
part gives birth to more order in the second part? What I get is the key role of
the temporal aspect: again, noncommutativity means that the temporal order
in which operations (measurements, in this case) are done matters, that they
change the result.
     And—here comes the surprise—we encounter a similar noncommutativity
in Freud and Lacan, in their description of the psychoanalytic process. The
title of Freud’s short text from 1914, “Remembering, Repeating and Working
Through,” provides the best formula for the way non-commutativity works
in the psychoanalytic process. The three concepts Freud mentions form a
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real            67


dialectical triad: they designate the three phases of the analytical process, and
resistance intervenes in every passage from one phase to the next. The first
step consists in remembering the repressed past traumatic events, in bringing
them out, which can also be done by hypnosis. This phase immediately runs
into a deadlock: the content brought out lacks its proper symbolic context and
thus remains ineffective; it fails to transform the subject and resistance remains
active, limiting the amount of content revealed.
   The problem with this approach is that it stays focused on the past and
ignores the subject’s present constellation which keeps this past alive,
symbolically active. Resistance expresses itself in the form of transference:
what the subject cannot properly remember, she repeats, transferring the past
constellation onto a present (e.g., she treats the analyst as if he were her father).
What the subject cannot properly remember, she acts out, re-enacts ‒ and
when the analyst points this out, her intervention is met with resistance.
Working through is working through the resistance, turning it from the
obstacle into the very resort of analysis, and this turn is self-reflexive in a
properly Hegelian sense: resistance is a link between object and subject,
between past and present, a proof that we are not only fixated on the past but
that this fixation is an effect of the present deadlock in the subject’s libidinal
economy. The lesson is thus that remembrance alone doesn’t count: it moves
the analysis forward only against the background of repetition (as part of the
transference)—so remembrance counts only if it comes after repetition. In
Seminar XI, Lacan points out that remembrance

   can be obtained more completely by other ways than analysis, but they are
   inoperant as far as cure is concerned. It is here that we must distinguish
   the scope of these two directions, remembering and repetition. From the
   one to the other, there is no more temporal orientation than there is
   reversibility. It is simply that they are not commutative—to begin by
   remembering in order to deal with the resistances of repetition is not the
   same thing as to begin by repetition in order to tackle remembering. It is
   this that shows us that the time-function is of a logical order here, and
   bound up with a signifying shaping of the real. Non-commutativity, in
   effect, is a category that belongs only to the register of the signifier.5
68                                Quantum History


     While fully accepting the importance of factual truth—or, in this case, not a
physical fact but his interpretation that explains the patient’s symptoms—a
psychoanalyst has to tell this to the patient at the right moment, when
(based upon his analytic experience) he is convinced that his statement will
deeply affect the patient’s subjectivity, pushing him towards accepting some
repressed truths about his subjectivity and desires. If the psychoanalyst tells
this to his patient too early, the patient will dismiss it as irrelevant. For the
truth to have an effect on those to whom it is told, it matters when it is told to
them—and, obviously, the same goes for political statements. Jean-Paul Sartre
formulated this paradox perfectly in a passage that we already quoted: “when
the authorities find it useful to tell the truth, it’s because they can’t find any
better lie. Immediately this truth, coming from official mouths, becomes a lie
corroborated by the facts.”6 If the factual truth is told outside repetition and
transference (which guarantee the subject’s full engagement in what is told), it
functions as a lie in the guise of truth.
     Jean-Pierre Dupuy formulated a similar insight about social processes when
he dealt with counterfactual situations—situations which are vaguely parallel
to superpositions which disappeared in the collapse of a wave function. Dupuy
returns again and again to the distinction between the two types of conditional
proposition, counterfactual and indicative: “If Shakespeare did not write
Hamlet, someone else did” is an indicative proposition, while “If Shakespeare
had not written Hamlet, someone else would have done it” is counterfactual.
The first one is obviously true since it starts from the fact that Hamlet is here,
was written, and someone had to write it. The second one is much more
problematic since it presupposes that there was a deeper historical tendency/
necessity pushing towards a play like Hamlet, so even if Shakespeare were not
to write it, another writer would have done it.7 In this case, we are dealing with
a rather crude historical determinism reminding us of what Georgi Plekhanov,
in his classic text on the role of individuals in world history, said about
Napoleon: there was a deeper historical necessity of the passage from Republic
to Empire, so if, owing to some accident, Napoleon were not to have become
the Emperor, another individual would have played his role.
     Is exactly the same distinction not at work in how we consider Stalinism?
For many, the rise of Stalinism was necessary, so that even without Stalin or in
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real          69


the case of his early accidental death, another leader would have played his
role, maybe even Trotsky, his great opponent. For Trotskyites, but also some
others like Stephen Kotkin, the role of Stalin’s contingent person was crucial:
no Stalinism without Stalin, i.e., if Stalin were to have disappeared from the
historical scene in the early or mid-1920s, things like the forced collectivization
and the practice of the “construction of Socialism in one country” would not
have taken place.
   Was then the rise of Stalinism a simple accident, the actualization of one
of the historical possibilities that were laying dormant within the situation
after the victory of the October Revolution? Dupuy proposes here a more
complex logic, the logic of retroactively transforming an accidental act into the
expression of a necessity: “necessity is retrospective: before I act, it was not
necessary that I act as I do; once I have acted, it will always have been true that
I could not have acted otherwise than I did.”8 Stalin could have died or he
could have been deposed, but once he won, his victory retroactively became
necessary. It is the same with Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon: he could have
acted otherwise, but once he did it, crossing the Rubicon became his fate, he
retroactively became (pre)destined to do it.
   This properly dialectical relationship between necessity and contingency
is radically different from Plekhanov’s determinism: the point is not that, if
Caesar were not to accomplish the fateful first step from the Republic to the
Empire, there would have been another person to serve as the vehicle of this
historical necessity—Caesar made a contingent choice which retroactively
became necessary. That is to say, we, of course, cannot change the past causally,
at the level of facts, we cannot retroactively undo what actually happened, but
we can change it counterfactually. In Hitchcock’s Vertigo, the past is also
changed in this way. What Scottie first experiences is the loss of Madeleine,
his fatal love; when he recreates Madeleine in Judy and then realizes that the
Madeleine he knew already was Judy pretending to be Madeleine, what he
discovers is not simply that Judy is a fake (he knew that she is not the true
Madeleine, since he recreated a copy of Madeleine out of her), but that, because
she is NOT a fake—she IS Madeleine—Madeleine herself was already a fake. His
discovery thus changes the past: he discovers that what he lost (Madeleine)
never existed . . . To understand properly such a backward movement in time,
70                               Quantum History


a brief reference to Deleuze might be of some help. In his early masterpiece
Difference and Repetition, Deleuze introduces the notion of “dark precursor”:
“Thunderbolts explode between different intensities, but they are preceded
by an invisible, imperceptible dark precusor (precurseur sombre), which
determines their path in advance, but in reverse, as though intagliated.”9 The
precise expression “in advance, but in reverse” is crucial here:

     “Because the path it traces is invisible and becomes visible only in reverse,
     to the extent that it is traveled over and covered by the phenomenon
     it induces within the system, it has no place other than that from which
     it is “missing,” no identity other than that which it lacks: it is precisely
     the object = x, the one which is “lacking in its place” as it lacks its own
     identity.”10

Or, as Ian Buchanan put it in a concise way: “Dark precursors are those
moments in a text which must be read in reverse if we are not to mistake
effects for causes.”11 A dark precursor overtakes itself, points towards the
future, comes from the future, but only in reverse, once this future is here.
Does Marx not say something like this in the well-known passage from
Grundrisse about men as the key to the anatomy of apes? The anatomy of apes
points towards the future, can only be understood from the future, but this
holds only in reverse, once this future is here. What this means is nothing less
than a reversal of causal order: as Lacan emphasizes in his Seminar I, symptom
is not simply an effect of past repressed causes, its meaning is not predetermined,
it is (re)constructed through interpretation—in short, symptom is a signal
coming from the future. As the analytic work proceeds, an interpretation is
achieved at some later time that casts the whole behaviour into relief in a
wholly different light, and makes its sense clear—or, as Bruce Fink put it:

     “Lacan parts ways from the outset with certain Anglo-American trends in
     psychoanalysis by stressing that history is not the past: it is not so much
     remembering that goes on in analysis, but reconstruction. According to
     Lacan, Freud more regularly emphasizes “the aspect of reconstruction than
     that of reliving, in the sense we have grown used to calling affective. The
     precise reliving—that the subject remembers something as truly belonging
     to him, as having truly been lived through, with which he communicates,
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real           71


   and which he adopts—we have the most explicit indication in Freud’s
   writings that that is not what is essential. What is essential is reconstruction,
   the term he employs right up until the end. [I]t is less a matter of
   remembering than of rewriting history.” This leads Lacan to formulate that
   while the unconscious is ideally inaccessible, it is realized in the symbolic;
   more precisely, “it is something which, thanks to the symbolic progress
   which takes place in analysis, will have been.” At some point in the future, its
   past configuration will be determined; it is always caught up in a future
   perfect. As for the symptom, its meaning will also be realized (not
   “discovered” as the translator would have us believe). Meaning is not there
   from the outset, but constructed during the analytic process.12

This notion of the unconscious implies that the Cartesian identity of thinking
and being (cogito ergo sum) covers up a gap which can be formulated in two
ways. First there is the predominant (basically Jungian) way: our thinking is
just a tip of the iceberg, beneath it there is a vast, deep and invisible domain of
drives which form the true core of our being. Then there is the opposite way
formulated by late Lacan: in the forced choice between thinking and being,
the subject has to choose being, and the Freudian unconscious is precisely a
decentered thinking, a thinking outside what I am, a thinking in which I
cannot recognize myself. It thinks, and I am not where I really think.
                                     *
The old saying attributed to Mark Twain but first recorded during a debate in
the Danish parliament in 1948, “It is difficult to make predictions, especially
about the future,” is thus deeply meaningful: every future creates its own past,
so while we can to some extent predict the future it is much more difficult to
predict how the new future will transform our notion of the past. It is also in
this sense that, for Lacan, the status of the unconscious is not ontological (a
deep substance of our psychic life) but ethical: it is the ethical task of the
analytic process to realize it. And before we succumb to the temptation to
dismiss this notion of the symptom as something confined to the early Lacan
prone to the idealist notion of the Symbolic, we should recall that in one of his
last texts, he also says that “the meaning of the symptom depends upon the
future of the real.”13 Is he not describing here the same retroactive determination
of the past by the future?
72                                Quantum History


     So in what sense does Lacan mention “the future of the real”? For Lacan, a
true interpretation is not just another symbolic semblance but a discourse
which is not of a semblance (the title of one of Lacan’s late seminars): it
has effects in the real, it transforms the real of the patient’s subjectivity.
Interpretation is not just a different symbolization of the unconscious real, it
changes the basic coordinates of the real core of its subjectivity—if it is
formulated at the right moment of the analytic process. Here time enters again:
an interpretation has effects in the real only if it is formulated at the right
moment, otherwise it remains a symbolic bla-bla, a semblance which leaves
the real unaffected—so no wonder that the patient as a rule easily agrees with
it. A direct acceptance of an interpretation is a proof that it has no effects in the
real, that it leaves the core of the patient indifferent.
     Dupuy uses the example of seduction. Especially today, in our Politically
Correct times, a seduction process always involves the risky move of “making
a pass”—at this potentially dangerous moment, one exposes oneself, one
intrudes into another person’s intimate space. The danger resides in the fact
that, if my pass is rejected, it will appear as a Politically Incorrect act of
harassment; so there is an obstacle I have to overcome. Here, however, a subtle
asymmetry enters: if my pass is accepted, it is not that I have successfully
overcome the obstacle—what happens is that, retroactively, I learn that there
never was an obstacle to be overcome.14 Do we not find a homologous paradox
of asymmetrical choice in the Gospel according to John, when Christ says he
did not come to judge but to save, rejecting the very practice of judgment—
don’t judge (others) for you will yourself be judged? The text then goes on:

     Whoever believes in him is not judged [ou krinetai], but whoever does not
     believe is judged [kekritai] already, because he has not believed in the name
     of the only Son of God. And this is the judgment: the light has come into the
     world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their
     works were evil.
                                                               (John 3:18–19 ESV)

The temporality is here crucial: there is no present moment of judgment when
you are judged—you either are not judged or you have already been judged.
What is excluded is the possibility of being judged and found innocent, the
             Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real         73


same as in Dupuy’s example of seduction: either you fail and the obstacle
remains in force (you are rejected as a harassing intruder) or there was no
obstacle—there is no room in this formulation for the possibility of successfully
overcoming the obstacle. And, incidentally, exactly the same asymmetry is at
work in the Hegelian dialectical process: the subject either stumbles upon an
insurmountable obstacle or he realizes that there is no obstacle at all, that what
appeared to him as an obstacle is the very condition of his success.
   However, there is a dark obverse of this case. On September 2, 1998, the
Swissair flight 111 from JFK to Geneva crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
southwest of Halifax, and all 229 people on board died. The investigation took
over four years, and it disclosed that the inflammable material used in the
aircraft’s structure allowed a fire to spread beyond the control of the crew,
resulting in a loss of control and the crash of the aircraft. After exposing a
series of mistakes made by the pilots and the ground control, a report in the
National Geographic Air Crash Investigation series ends by raising the
question: if the pilots had avoided all mistakes, what then? The sad answer is:
the flight was doomed from the beginning, no correct moves would have made
a difference. So it is not that “if the pilots had acted differently, the tragedy
would have been avoided”—the counterfactual past possibility is retroactively
canceled. This is how the past can be changed counterfactually: when we learn
that the flight was doomed from the beginning, nothing changes at the level of
(past) facts, what changes are just counterfactual possibilities . . . Let’s finish
this series of cases with the highest one from theology: the sin and the Fall. Is
this case also noncommutative? Recall Hegel’s characterization of rational
consideration itself as evil:

   Abstractly, being evil means singularizing myself in a way that cuts me off
   from the universal (which is the rational, the laws, the determinations of
   spirit). But along with this separation there arises being-for-itself and for
   the first time the universally spiritual, laws—what ought to be. So it is not
   the case that rational consideration has an external relationship to evil: it is
   itself what is evil.15

The serpent says that by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Adam and
Eve will become like God; and after the two do it, God comments: “Behold,
74                                Quantum History


Adam has become like one of us.”(Genesis 3:22) Hegel’s comment is: “So the
serpent did not lie, for God confirms what it said.” Then Hegel goes on to reject
the claim that what God says is meant with irony: “Cognition is the principle
of spirituality, and this . . . is also the principle by which the injury of the
separation is healed. It is in this principle of cognition that the principle of
‘divinity’ is also posited.”16 Subjective freedom is not just the possibility to
choose evil or good,

     it is the consideration or the cognition that makes people evil, so that
     consideration and cognition themselves are what is evil, and that
     therefore such cognition is what ought not to exist because it is the source
     of evil.17

The Good emerges as a possibility and duty only through this primordial/
constitutive choice of Evil: we experience the Good when, after choosing Evil,
we become aware of the utter inadequacy of our situation. The queerness of
the Law thus reaches its apogee in Christianity in which we, humans, are a
priori presumed to be fallen, to dwell in sin, so that the entire reign of the law
consists of the rules of how to deal with our violations of the law: through
confessions and other modes of ritualized repentance. That’s why, as many
perspicuous theologians knew, the Fall is felix culpa, the fortunate fault / the
blessed fall—or, as St. Augustine put it: “For God judged it better to bring good
out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist.” We have to add another step to
this reasoning: in order to bring good out of evil, the Good itself—God—has
to bring evil out of itself. This is why we should turn around the standard
Christian (or Catholic, more precisely) explanation of why there is evil in the
world: god gave us freedom, and freedom is the freedom to choose what we
freely decide, inclusive of evil . . . But is it not the other way round? God (more
than just exposed us to the temptation of evil, he) pushed us into evil so that we
would discover our freedom. There is no freedom without evil since, as Hegel
knew very well, to be able to choose between good and evil one already has to
be in evil.
     Is, consequently, the paradox of the forced choice not inscribed already into
the structure of God’s original gift of freedom to humanity? Humans are given
freedom—with the expectation that they will misuse it to break free from the
            Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real            75


Creator, i.e., to become effectively free. The only way to use the gift of freedom
without incurring guilt is not to use it at all—in short, what we find here is the
very structure of the forced choice: “you are free to choose—on condition that
you make the wrong choice . . .” No wonder that, according to the standard
Gnostic reading of the Fall, the snake which tempts Eve in the Paradise is a
benevolent agent of wisdom, trying to impart knowledge to Adam and Eve
imprisoned within the walls of Paradise by their evil Creator who wants to
keep them in ignorance. God himself, by way of explicitly prohibiting Adam
and Eve to eat the apple from the tree of knowledge, effectively wants them to
violate his prohibition, to make the step into knowing good and evil and thus
becoming aware of the shame of their nakedness. God is here himself
inconsistent, divided, saying one thing and, between the lines, giving another
covert injunction.
   As Kierkegaard puts it, the prohibition awakens the possibility of freedom—
the freedom to violate the prohibition, i.e., to eat from the tree of knowledge of
the difference of Good and Evil. God engages here in a perverse strategy: in
pronouncing the prohibitive Word, he solicits man to violate this prohibition
and thereby become human—as St Augustine put it long ago (in his Enchiridion,
xxvii): “God judged it better to bring good out of evil, than to allow no evil to
exist.” Or, as Hegel, Kierkegaard’s great opponent, would have it, knowledge
is not just the possibility to choose evil or good, “it is the consideration or
the cognition that makes people evil, so that consideration and cognition
themselves are what is evil, and that therefore such cognition is what ought
not to exist because it is the source of evil.”18 In short, prohibition precedes what
it prohibits, or, as Kierkegaard puts it, the explanation anticipates what is
subsequent. The knowledge gained by Adam and Eve after eating from the tree
is nonetheless not simply empty—here is what happens after they taste the
apple:

   Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were
   naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
   Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was
   walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord
   God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man,
76                               Quantum History


     “Where are you?” The man answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was
     afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” And he said, “Who told you that
     you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not
     to eat from?”
                                                                  (Genesis 3:7–11)

Before eating from the tree, the two were already naked, they just didn’t know
they were naked—they fell literally like the proverbial cat above the precipice
which falls down only after it looks down and notices there is no ground under
its feet. The shift involved in the Fall is thus purely subjective, it involves a
different attitude towards what Adam and Eve are: the two of them merely
realize (register, take note of) what they are—as in the famous passage from
Moliere in which a guy, when told that he is speaking prose—a new word for
him—asserts with pleasure that he knows how to speak prose. What betrayed
their Fall to God was not their brash display of nakedness, but their feeling
of shame at realizing that they are naked—one can say that their very moral
feeling of shame made them guilty. Recall Alphonse Allais’s old joke when he
pointed at a woman walking along a street and shouted: “Look at her! Beneath
her clothes, she is totally naked!” In exactly the same way, a human being is
guilty only under the cover of his/her shame. And is it not the same with the
punishment that befalls them (they will die)? In the same way that they were
already naked, they were also already mortal, they just didn’t relate to their
mortality—as Heidegger would have put it, animals die, but only man relates
to his death as his innermost (im)possibility. So when God enounces the
punishment, he just spells out what Adam and Eve already realized when they
noticed that they are naked, namely their misery as two weak mortal beings.
     To reintroduce here the term “observation,” one should point out that at the
level of physical reality, nothing happens with the Fall: the Fall (eating the apple
and gaining knowledge) means just that Adam and Eve register/observe what
they were already doing. As Augustine emphasized, of course there was sex in
paradise before the Fall, but sexual acts were performed as a simple instrumental
activity, like cutting woods or gathering fruits from the trees—there was no
surplus-enjoyment in it, this enjoyment came only with awareness. And this
fact allows us to introduce a noncommutative sequence of events: there is no
             Noncommutativity in the Symbolic and in the (Quantum) Real          77


sin before its prohibition, and there is no Good before Evil. Sins are the same
acts we were doing before prohibition, we were just not aware (observing) that
we are doing them. Observation thus changes an innocent act into sin. In a
similar way, we were not Good before choosing Evil because choice as such is
Evil. So Fall is not a fall from goodness, Fall retroactively creates what it falls
from.
   This brings us to another important topic: that of counterfactual situations.
They are something that is immanent to reality itself: things are not just what
they are, their actuality is accompanied by the shadow of what would have
happened if a different course of action were to be taken. For example, when
in 2020 we decided to impose a quarantine to curb the spreading of the Covid
pandemic, we did this to diminish the amount of infections and deaths.
However, there is a key distinction to be made here:

   I have a choice of two actions, A and B. I choose A. I estimate that I am in a
   better situation in the option A than in the option B, as far as I can appreciate
   it after I have chosen A. However, I have no guarantee that if I were to choose
   B, my situation would have been the same as the one that I envisage for B
   after having chosen A. In other words, the presupposition is that the “actual”
   (i.e., real) choice of B puts me into the same world as the “counterfactual”
   (i.e., virtual, “against the facts”) choice of B if I’ve chosen A. Even more
   simply, the hidden hypothesis is that the “alternate” worlds have the same
   reality as the world in which we really find ourselves.19

We should abandon this hypothesis, not just for obvious empirical reasons—our
counterfactual estimation of what would have happened if we were to choose B
(no or much less quarantines) could simply turn out to be wrong—remember
how, in the Summer of 2020, when the UK authorities prohibited access to
beaches: when this prohibition was largely ignored and the beaches were packed,
this led to almost no increase in infections. To put it simply, A is not the same
after I’ve chosen B—after I’ve chosen B, A is measured by the standards which
made me choose B. And this brings us back to (Rovelli’s reading of) Zeilinger’s
experiment: does this experiment not clearly prove that Lacan’s formulation is
wrong, i.e., that non-commutativity is NOT “a category that belongs only to the
register of the signifier”?
78                              Quantum History


     But are things really so simple? What if we risk a radical hypothesis
according to which the “weirdness” of quantum phenomena resides in the fact
that we encounter there phenomena which we thought are unique to the
symbolic universe in which humans dwell? The claim “it seems that you need
only to observe for what is happening to change” should be read very precisely,
in its literal meaning: the change is caused not by an element being observed
but by an observation which sees nothing. Does this “astonishing thing” not
come close to what Saussure called differentiality? If the identity of an entity
resides only in its differences from other entities, then the fact that something
doesn’t happen (at a place in the structure where it was expected to happen)
counts as a positive fact.

 Names for finitude: Hegel,
    Heidegger, Pippin


Robert Pippin was for decades among the most outspoken American Hegelians,
defending Hegel’s idealist legacy not only against the post-Hegelian turn
towards non-discursive or non-notional reality but also rejecting Heidegger’s
treatment of Hegel. So it comes as a shock when, in his new book The
Culmination1, he endorses Heidegger’s characterization of Hegel’s thought as
the culmination of Western metaphysics, as the full deployment of its basic
premise that being equals logos, i.e., that the truth of everything that exists (or
that can exist) can be articulated in the form of discursive judgments, so that
the full system of logic is at the same time a full ontology, the description of
conditions that everything that exists should meet. The post-Hegelian thinkers
were right to claim that something escapes this closed circle of logical categories
and mediations, but they were wrong in trying to locate this missing dimension
in some form of pre-logical positive reality (will, productive process,
unconscious drives . . .). It is only Heidegger who really breaks out of the
Hegelian closed circle, pointing out that we (humans) are finite beings thrown
into a historically destined disclosure of Being which predetermines what
“matters” to us, our horizon of the meaningfulness of Being—Hegel himself
doesn’t see how his own Logic already relies on a disclosure of Being as
immanently structured by logical categories, judgments, and syllogistic
mediations. A new beginning is thus needed, and Heidegger gives hints that
only a non-discursive poetic thinking can do the job.

     It is easy for the so-called “rationalist” philosophers to make fun of
Heidegger’s “poetic” thinking. Apropos of what is perhaps the best known
single line from a film noir, the final remark of the doomed hero in Edgar G.
Ulmer’s Detour (“Fate or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or
me for no good reason at all.”), one cannot but imagine how this line should be
translated into the old Greek and then provided by a Heideggerian commentary
pondering on the primordial way the Greeks experienced the tension between
Fate and Reason, along the lines of “The Reason /the Ground, the hidden, self-
withdrawing foundation/ of our Fate is the Fate, the abyssal game, that names
the Event of the coming-forth of the epochal Reason of our Being itself ” . . .
However, one cannot get rid of Heidegger in such an easy way—he deserves a
much more radical confrontation.
     While Heidegger characterizes Hegel as the “culmination” not only of German
Idealism but of the entire history of Western philosophy, he also reserves a
special place for Schelling as the “peak” of German Idealism: Heidegger’s idea
was that “while Schelling is the peak or Gipfel of German idealism, Hegel is its
culmination, Vollendung.”(xi) In what does this difference between culmination
and peak consist? Culmination is the point at which a certain system or process
actualizes its immanent potentials, achieves its complete form—in the case of
Hegel, his logic marks the point at which the metaphysical identity of being and
discursive knowability (only what can be rationally known really exists) is fully
realized. Peak means the moment in a certain system or process when one of its
elements (thinkers, in this case) reaches the highest level in the sense that it
already surpasses the limits of that system, signposting a dimension that eludes
the system—for Heidegger, Schelling in his essay on freedom displays the unclear
premonition of a dimension beyond metaphysics.
     So what if we apply this duality of peak and culmination to Heidegger
himself, in conjunction with the ongoing process of the full naturalization/
objectivization of being-human that occurs in today’s cognitive sciences? With
his notion of disclosure as a historical a priori of every epoch, Heidegger brings
transcendental metaphysics to its culmination, providing its ultimate version,
while with their notion of the wired brain, today’s cognitive sciences designate
a peak of scientific knowability which undermines its very bearer, the subject
practicing science.
                    Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                83


   But one should take a step further: what if Hegel himself, the very core of
his thought ignored by Heidegger, is also split between its culmination and its
peak? Let’s refer here to Heidegger’s notion of the onto-theological structure of
metaphysics: Hegel’s dialectics culminates in the reflexive redoubling through
which the gap that separates subject from Substance is transposed into the
Substance itself: with Christ, the fall of man from god is transposed into the
fall of god from himself, etc. We have to supplement this ontological redoubling
of the gap (a redoubling which undermines the very foundation of metaphysics)
with the peak of Hegel’s dialectics, with its excessive moment which protrudes
from its edifice: the space for the experience of the “divine” is the gap that
forever separates the transcendental from the objective-realist approach, but
this “divine” dimension refers to the moment of madness preceding discourse,
to the experience of radical negativity (what mystics and Hegel called the
“night of the world”) which precludes any theology focused on a positive
figure of god, even if this figure of god is radically secularized in modern
scientific naturalism.
   Recall Kierkegaard’s claim about the futility of philosophical systems (his
target here is, of course, Hegel): “In relation to their systems most systematizers
are like a man who builds an enormous castle and lives in a shack close by; they
do not live in their own enormous systematic buildings.”2 As is often the case
in Kierkegaard’s critique of Hegel, he misses the point here and ignores his
own proximity to Hegel: the final result of the Hegelian movement is precisely
that enormous castles are only finished when they are accompanied/
supplemented by a small shack in which the subject who built them has to
dwell . . . In short, to paraphrase Hegel’s well-known programmatic slogan
from his Phenomenology: one should conceive the Absolute not only as a
magnificent castle but also as a small shack attached to it. (Or the Christian
version: one should conceive God not only as the majestic creator or everything
but also as a miserable individual walking around Palestine 2,000 years ago;
today, his place would have been without doubt in the ruins of Gaza.) In his
Castle, Kafka himself has a clear premonition of this paradox: the novel’s hero
decides to climb up the hill and approaches the majestic castle on the top of it;
however, the more he comes close to the castle, the more he notices that the
castle is not composed of majestic buildings but of dirty small shacks . . .
84                                Quantum History


     Pippin makes the move from Hegel’s culmination of metaphysics as logic to
the finite existence of a Dasein thrown into a historical world of a disclosed
meaning—but is this move the ultimate one? Do we not find in Hegel himself
(and Schelling) an Ansatz for a move beyond/beneath Heidegger? The
dimension of radical madness, the “night of the world,” the pain of infinite
difference, is prior to the openness to a meaningful disclosure of being.
Schelling begins his Ages of the World with: logos is at the beginning, but what
was BEFORE the beginning?3 Heidegger indicates that the culmination of
Western metaphysics, of its reduction of being to discursive knowability (i.e.,
Hegel’s elaboration of logic as a complete account of the conditions of the
knowability of being and, consequently, of being itself), precisely because of its
completion makes palpable that something is missing, that something is left
out, ignored: it “reveals finally what is missing or left out, or what remains
unasked.”(11) The so-called post-Hegelian thought was obviously aware of
this ignored dimension; but Heidegger repeatedly claims that it tries to fill in
this gap with some new positive substantial mode of being (will to power,
social-material process, the unconscious . . .) which just turns around the
metaphysics without effectively stepping out of it.
     My thesis is that while this is true, it was none other than Hegel himself,
the point of culmination of metaphysical idealism, who was fully aware of
this limitation and included it into his system. Hegel’s name for the radical
finitude of our predicament is none other than ABSOLUTE KNOWING
(AK).4 The first obvious fact that bears witness to this finitude is Hegel’s
strict prohibition to engage in speculations about future: philosophy (and
science) can only paint grey on grey, what will come is radically open, in no
way to be derived from the past and present—here is Hegel’s well-known
formulation:

     Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought
     to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late.
     Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has
     completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus
     corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of
     reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                 85


   world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When
   philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by
   means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva,
   takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.5

Hegel’s point here is not that we can only fully know the past, but a much more
radical one: each historical epoch implies its own vision of the past, it
reconstructs it retroactively from its standpoint—we cannot rely even on
our knowledge of the past (in the same way as, in quantum mechanics,
each collapse retroactively structures its own genesis). This is what Hegel
calls “Absolute Knowing [Wissen], not cognition [Erkenntniss]”: the end-point
of dialectical reversals, when the subject stumbles upon the final limitation,
the limitation as such, a limitation which can no longer be inverted into a
productive self-assertion. Contrary to the misleading appearances, Absolute
Knowing “does not mean ‘knowing everything.’ It rather means—recognizing
one’s limitations.”6 “Absolute Knowing” is the final recognition of such a
limitation which is “absolute” in the sense that it is not a determinate, particular,
and as such a “relative” limit/obstacle to our knowledge, something we can
clearly see and locate as the limit/obstacle. It is invisible “as such” because
it is the limitation of the entire field as such, its closure which, from within
it (and we are always by definition within it, because this field in a way
“is” ourselves) cannot but appear as its opposite, as the very openness of the
field.
   It is commonplace to oppose Hegel as the ridiculous point of Absolute
Knowing to a more modest sceptical approach which recognizes the excess of
reality over every conceptualization. What if, however, it is Hegel who is much
more modest? What if his AK is the assertion of a radical closure: there is no
meta-language, we cannot step on our own shoulder and see our own limitation,
we cannot relativize/historicize ourselves, our own position? What is effectively
arrogant is, as Chesterton made it clear, precisely such self-relativization, the
attitude of “knowing one’s limitation,” of not agreeing with oneself—as the
proverbial “wise” insight according to which we can only approach reality
asymptotically. What Hegel’s AK deprives us of is precisely this minimal self-
distance, the safety-distance from our own location.
86                                 Quantum History


     That is to say, Hegel’s ultimate point is not that, in spite of our limitation, of
our embeddedness in a contingent historical context, we—or Hegel himself, at
least—can somehow overcome this limitation and gain access to Absolute
Knowledge (to which historicist relativism then responds that we cannot ever
gain access to this position, that we can only aim at it as at an impossible Ideal).
What he calls Absolute Knowing is, on the contrary, the very sign of our total
capture—we are CONDEMNED to Absolute Knowing, we cannot ESCAPE it,
since “Absolute Knowing” means that there is no external point of reference
with regard to which we could perceive the relativity of our own “merely
subjective” standpoint. All determinate being is relational, things only are what
they are in relation to their otherness, or, as Deleuze put it, perspectival
distortion is inscribed into the very identity of the thing. The real is not out
there, as the inaccessible transcendent X never reached by our representations;
the real is here, as the obstacle/impossibility which makes our representations
flawed, inconsistent. The real is not the In-itself but the very obstacle which
distorts our access to the In-itself, and this paradox provides the key for what
Hegel calls “Absolute Knowing.”
     And the same goes for immortality which is the obverse of finitude.7 The
axiom of the philosophy of finitude is that one cannot escape finitude/mortality
as the unsurpassable horizon of our existence; Lacan’s axiom is that, no matter
how much one tries, one cannot escape immortality. But what if this choice is
false—what if finitude and immortality, like lack and excess, also form a
parallax couple, what if they are the same from a different point of view? What
if immortality is an object that is a remainder/excess over finitude, what if
finitude is an attempt to escape from the excess of immortality? What if
Kierkegaard was right here, but for the wrong reason, when he also understood
the claim that we, humans, are just mortal beings who disappear after their
biological death as an easy way to escape the ethical responsibility that comes
with the immortal soul? He was right for the wrong reason insofar as he
equated immortality with the divine and ethical part of a human being—but
there is another immortality. What Cantor did for infinity, we should do for
immortality, and assert the multiplicity of immortalities: the Badiouian noble
immortality/infinity of the deployment of an Event (as opposed to the finitude
of a human animal) comes after a more basic form of immortality which
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                 87


resides in what Lacan calls the Sadean fundamental fantasy: the fantasy of
another, ethereal body of the victim, which can be tortured indefinitely and
nonetheless magically retains its beauty (recall the Sadean figure of the young
girl sustaining endless humiliations and mutilations from her depraved
torturer and somehow mysteriously surviving it all intact, in the same way
Tom and Jerry and other cartoon heroes survive all their ridiculous ordeals
intact). In this form, the comical and the disgustingly-terrifying (recall different
versions of the “undead”—zombies, vampires, etc.—in popular culture) are
inextricably connected.
   The same immortality underlies the intuition of something indestructible
in a truly radical Evil. Adorno was right when he wrote that when one
encounters a truly evil person, it is difficult to imagine that this person can die.
This immortality is ambiguous: Evil is indestructible, but so is the suffering of
evil persons after their death. No wonder that, in his The Day Of Doom, Michael
Wigglesworth’s dark description of the suffering of sinners after the Judgment
Day published in the American colonies in 16628, this suffering is described as
obscene undeadness: “Their pain and grief have no relief, their anguish never
endeth. There must they lie, and never die, though dying every day.”
   We are of course not immortal, we all (will) die—the “immortality” of the
death drive is not a biological fact but a psychic stance of “persisting beyond
life and death,” of a readiness to go on beyond the limits of life, of a perverted
life-force which bears witness to a “deranged relationship towards life.” Lacan’s
name for this derangement is, of course, jouissance, excessive enjoyment,
whose pursuit can make us neglect or even self-sabotage our vital needs and
interests. At this precise point, Lacan radically differs from the thinkers of
finitude for whom a human being is a being-towards-death, relating to its own
finitude and unavoidable death: it is only through the intervention of jouissance
that a human animal becomes properly mortal, relating to the prospect of its
own extinction. Lacan notes apropos of the “life and death dialogue” how “it
only acquires the character of a drama from the moment when enjoyment
[jouisssance] intervenes. The vital point . . . is the deranged relationship to one’s
own body called enjoyment.”9
   Both Hegel and Heidegger thus advocate the end of philosophy, but, to
complicate things further, none of the two is original in this claim. The topic of
88                              Quantum History


the end of philosophy dominates European philosophy from Kant onwards:
Kant designates his critical approach as a prolegomena to a future philosophy
(metaphysics); Fichte talks about “doctrine of science (Wissenschaftslehre)”
instead of philosophy; Hegel saw his system as no longer just philo-sophy (love
of wisdom) but knowledge itself; Marx opposed philosophy to the study of
actual life, etc. till Heidegger whose motto was “the end of philosophy and the
task of thinking.” There is a deep paradox in this fact. It is only with Kant’s
revolution, with his notion of the transcendental, that philosophy came to
itself. Is it not that, ultimately, philosophy AS SUCH begins with Kant, with his
transcendental turn? Is it not that the entire previous philosophy can be
understood properly—not as the simple description of the “entire universe,” of
the totality of beings, but as the description of the horizon within which
entities disclose themselves to a finite human being—only if read
“anachronistically,” from the standpoint opened up by Kant? Is it not that it was
Kant who also opened up the field within which Heidegger himself was able to
formulate the notion of Dasein as the place in which beings appear within a
historically determined/destined horizon of meaning?
     I am well aware that Heidegger would never accept the use of the term
“transcendental” for his approach since “transcendental” is for him irreducibly
branded by the notion of modern subjectivity. In spite of that, I keep this term
since I think it remains the most appropriate one to indicate the idea of a
horizon within which entities appear to us. Heidegger, of course, makes a key
step forward with regard to Kant who remains within the horizon of being as
the substance enduring in time, as a standing presence. But does today’s
“postmodern” notion of reality as a dynamic flow of non-substantial
appearances (with references to Buddhism) not break with the notion of being
as a standing presence?
                                      *
Today we don’t only live in an era of the proclaimed end of philosophy—we
live in an era of the double end of philosophy. At the very beginning of his The
Grand Design, Stephen Hawking triumphantly proclaims that “philosophy is
dead.”10 With the latest advances in quantum physics and cosmology, the
so-called experimental metaphysics reaches its apogee: metaphysical questions
about the origins of the universe, etc., which were till now the topic of
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                  89


philosophical speculations, can now be answered through experimental
science and thus empirically tested . . . The prospect of a “wired brain” is a kind
of final point of the naturalization of human thought: when our process of
thinking can directly interact with a digital machine, it effectively becomes an
object in reality, it is no longer “our” inner thought as opposed to external
reality.
   On the other hand, today’s transcendental historicism insists that sciences
cannot provide the ultimate cognitive frame of our knowledge. Heidegger
gave to the transcendental approach an existential turn: philosophy as
transcendental-phenomenological ontology does not inquire into the nature
of reality, it analyzes how all of reality appears to us in a given epochal
constellation. In today’s age of techno-science, we consider as “really existing”
only what can be an object of scientific research—all other entities are reduced
to illusory subjective experiences, just imagined things, etc. Heidegger’s point
is not that such a view is more or less “true” than a premodern view, but that,
with the new disclosure of being that characterizes modernity, the very criteria
of what is “true” or “false” changed . . . It is not difficult to grasp the paradox of
such an approach: while Heidegger is perceived as a thinker uniquely focused
on the question of Being, he leaves out of consideration what we understand
by this question in our “naïve” pre-transcendental stance: how do things exist
independently of the way we relate to them, independently of how they appear
to us? In this context, I find it problematic, misleading even, how Pippin
formulates the relationship between Being and beings/entities:

   Being itself is at issue. Without Dasein, then, there are beings, and there
   would be a number of facts that would be true of such beings—what exists,
   what kinds exist, what might exist but does not—but there would be no
   Being qua Being, manifestness as such . . . Heidegger’s question is not “what
   is there?” but “what allows” beings to be manifest?
                                                                                 (60)

The disclosure of the meaning of Being of course doesn’t create or cause
entities; however, to draw from this the conclusion that, even without the
disclosure of Being “there would be a number of facts that would be true of
such beings—what exists, what kinds exist, what might exist but does not”—is
90                               Quantum History


deeply misleading. The terms Pippin uses here—the true facts about such
beings which exist even outside their ontological disclosure—are obviously
not ontologically neutral, they already appear only within a specific historical
disclosure of Being. As Heidegger himself was fully aware of, what is out there
(or here or anywhere) prior to a historical disclosure of Being, i.e., how to think
nature prior to the emergence of humans as Da-Sein, as the “here” of Being, is
a much more difficult question totally avoided by Pippin.
     The second critical point is that the problem of appearance is also Hegel’s
basic problem: Hegel’s big question is not “can we penetrate behind deceitful
appearances to true being” but exactly the opposite one: “reality” is in itself
stupid and flat, the true enigma is: why does (what we perceive as) reality
appear to itself? “Appear” implies here also falsity, illusion, misrecognition, i.e.,
a necessarily wrong appearance—not only as a secondary possibility, but as an
immanent condition of truth, or, to quote two of Lacan’s sayings, la verite surgit
de la meprise? (truth emerges out of misrecognition) and les non-dupes errent
(the non-duped err). This is also how Hegel’s well-known claim that the
Absolute has to be conceived “not only as substance but also as subject” is to be
understood: abstraction, tearing apart of a totality, misapprehension, are part
of the Absolute itself.
     So where does Hegel stand in the passage from traditional metaphysics to
the postmetaphysical nineteenth- and twentieth-century thought? Hegel is the
“vanishing mediator” between his “before” and his “after.” That is to say:
something happens in Hegel, a breakthrough into a unique dimension of
thought, which is obliterated, rendered invisible in its true dimension, by
postmetaphysical thought. This obliteration leaves an empty space which has
to be filled in so that the continuity of the development of philosophy can be
reestablished—filled in with what? The index of this obliteration is the
ridiculous image of Hegel as the absurd “absolute idealist” who “pretended to
know everything,” to possess Absolute Knowledge, to read the mind of God, to
deduce entire reality out of the self-movement of (his) mind—the image which
is an exemplary case of what Freud called Deck-Erinnerung (screen-memory),
a fantasy-formation intended to cover up a traumatic truth. In this sense, the
post-Hegelian term to “concrete reality, irreducible to notional mediation,”
should rather be read as a desperate posthumous revenge of metaphysics, as an
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                  91


attempt to reinstall metaphysics, albeit in the inverted form of the primacy of
concrete reality.
   When, in his Culmination, Robert Pippin moves from Hegel to Heidegger,
he misses this most radical dimension (beyond the transcendental) in Hegel’s
thought: like Heidegger, he reduces Hegel’s absolute idealism to the total
coincidence between being and (logical) knowability, thereby reducing
ontology to the notion’s self-deployment. However, the gap between logic and
reality remains in Hegel, at more than one level—ultimately, the gap is not
between logos and reality but in the thing itself, between (in Lacanian terms)
reality and the Real. Does already Hegel’s best-known formula (the Absolute
should be conceived not only as substance but also as subject) not point in this
direction? “Subject” does not stand here just for self-consciousness, its
discursive power of reflection, it stands also for a gap in the thing (Absolute)
itself—“subject” does not mean only that substance is dynamized, caught in
self-movement, it means above all that abstraction, illusion, partiality, etc., are
immanent to a totality. (The parallel with quantum mechanics cannot but
strike the eye here again.) Let me quote here again the well-known passage
from the “Foreword” to his Phenomenology of Spirit where Hegel provides the
most elementary formula of what does it mean to conceive Substance also as
Subject:

   The disparity which exists in consciousness between the I and the substance
   which is its object is the distinction between them, the negative in general.
   This can be regarded as the defect of both, though it is their soul, or that
   which moves them. That is why some of the ancients conceived the void as
   the principle of motion, for they rightly saw the moving principle as the
   negative, though they did not as yet grasp that the negative is the self. Now,
   although this negative appears at first as a disparity between the I and its
   object, it is just as much a disparity of the substance with itself. Thus what
   seems to happen outside of it, to be an activity directed against it, is really its
   own doing, and substance shows itself to be essentially subject.11

The final reversal is crucial: the disparity between subject and substance is
simultaneously the disparity of the substance with itself—or, to put it in Lacan’s
terms, disparity means that the lack of the subject is simultaneously the lack in
92                               Quantum History


the Other: subjectivity emerges when substance cannot achieve full identity
with itself, when substance is in itself “barred,” crossed by an immanent
impossibility or antagonism. In short, the subject’s epistemological ignorance,
its failure to fully grasp the opposed substantial content, simultaneously
indicates a limitation/failure/lack of the substantial content itself. Therein also
resides the key dimension of the theological revolution of Christianity: the
alienation of man from god has to be projected/transferred back into god
itself, as the alienation of god from itself (therein resides the speculative
content of the notion of divine kenosis)—this is the Christian version of
Hegel’s insight into how the disparity of subject and substance implies the
disparity of substance with regard to itself. This is why the unity of man and
god is enacted in Christianity in a way which fundamentally differs from the
way of pagan religions where man has to strive to overcome his fall from god
through the effort to purify his being from material filth and elevate himself to
rejoin god. In Christianity, on the contrary, god falls from itself, he becomes a
finite mortal human abandoned by god (in the figure of Christ and his lament
on the cross “Father, why have you forsaken me?”), and man can only achieve
unity with god by identifying with this god, the god abandoned by itself. Kant
misses this properly Christian dimension, and Pippin follows in Kant’s
footsteps:

     If it were not fully determinable, then the determinations would be hostage
     to something empirical or historical, and so not a matter of pure thinking.
     Brandom has developed a reading of conceptual determination in Hegel
     that argues for such an “open” form of thought’s self-determination, or for
     such a subjection.

                                                                             (143)

I am here on Brandom’s side: to take just two exemplary cases, the categories
from Hegel’s logic are simply not able to provide the coordinates for grasping
the mechanisms of the Freudian unconscious or the weird logic of wave
oscillations and superpositions in quantum mechanics. And I even think that,
if we properly read the Freudian unconscious, the two cases imply a clear
parallel. For Freud, the unconscious is not a substantial pre-discursive psychic
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                 93


entity, a drive that strives to express itself in different ways; it is the repressed
part of our symbolic universe, the part which exists in a virtual way, i.e., which
is not more real but in some sense less real than our conscious and preconscious
thoughts. In the terms of quantum physics, the unconscious are the superpositions
which are lost when a wave oscillation “collapses” in one determinate conscious
thought or statement: they don’t exist, they continue to insist as virtual entities.
   In this sense Lacan claims that the status of the unconscious is not
ontological but ethical—not only in the sense that the psychoanalytic process
is guided by the ethical maxim to confront the patient’s unconscious but, much
more radically, in the sense that the unconscious itself brought out through the
analytic process is not a deep truth already present deep in our psyche but an
ethical construct that results from the duty to put some order into our psychic
life: “ ‘If I am formulating here that the status of the unconscious is ethical . . .
it is precisely because Freud himself does not stress it when he gives the
unconscious its status.”12 Already in his early work, Freud indicates this apropos
a hysteric who “weeps at A” and “is quite unaware that he is doing so on account
of the association A-B, and B itself plays no part at all in his psychical life”13:

   Now this case is typical of repression in hysteria. We invariably find that a
   memory is repressed which has only become a trauma by deferred action.
   The cause of this state of things is the retardation of puberty as compared
   with the rest of the individual’s development.14

So it is not that the unconscious is simply B: B became traumatic only
retroactively (a classic case is that of Wolfman, Freud’s best known patient:
when as a small child he witnessed the a tergo sexual act of his parents, there
was nothing traumatic or sexual in it—it became traumatic only years later
when Wolfman developed his infantile sexual theories). The ethical act is here
not simply to remember the primordial scene but to dissociate it from its
traumatic impact which is conferred on it later, retroactively. To remember the
primordial scene involves linear causal determinism: one identifies the
ultimate cause of ongoing pathological phenomena. The space of freedom is
the space of retroactivity, and I retroactively reconstruct the past (in its
meaning) as an ethical project. Kafka made this clear in his late short story
“Investigations of a Dog”15 where he
94                                Quantum History


     delineates the metaphysical battlefield in terms of three distinct
     impossibilities: on the one side, desire for the impossible (Brod) and the
     possible is impossible (Kafka); on the other, nothing is impossible, the
     impossible is impossible (smirking wombs).16


The first option (for Kafka embodied in Max Brod) defines the life of the
majority of us, at least of those who still live in a world of traditional authority:
clear social rules (which you are often allowed to discreetly violate) define
what is possible and permit us only to dream about what is impossible (sexual
promiscuity and perversions, behaving badly, etc.). In Kafka’s world, this bar of
impossibility is displaced into the very heart of the possible, of our “normal”
daily life: the most ordinary acts and procedures become tainted by an
impossibility. (You try to eat a sandwich, it gets stuck in your throat; you try to
cross a street, your legs don’t follow your intention . . .)
     In Kafka, one often finds also the opposite paradox: you may be a world
champion in swimming, but you feel that you don’t know how to swim; you are
a top singer, but what comes out of your mouth is only a weird gargling . . .
Kafka perspicuously detects a third option that characterizes a modern
permissive world in which “Every womb is fruitful and smirks uselessly at the
world”:17 everything is productive and brings pleasure, you can easily do it, but
the result is no less frustrating, a stupid joyless pleasure . . . Is there a fourth
term? If Kafka’s third version is “there is nothing which is impossible”, so that
the impossible itself is impossible, this is not the same as actualizing the
impossible by way of changing the coordinates of what is possible. A true political
act occurs when something considered impossible is enacted and thus (to
use Dupuy’s formulation) retroactively creates its own possibility. Such an
enactment of the impossible is freedom: “the impossible receives its proper
conceptualization, is raised to the level of the concept—the ultimate name of
this concept being, for Kafka, ‘freedom.’ ”18 The third option in which “nothing
is impossible” gets unavoidably caught in paradoxes that characterize Cancel
Culture: the only way to guarantee that nothing is impossible is to carefully
comb the entire field of our activity to exclude acts which preclude others to
act with no impossibilities, so that the impossible returns in the guise of
prohibitive regulations. This is why, in his Is It Ever Just Sex?19, Darian Leader
                     Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                  95


problematizes the standard notion that, according to psychoanalysis,
everything we do or talk about is really about sex—as it says on the book cover:

   The old idea that sexuality is a smouldering, animalistic force within us,
   desperate for release yet restrained by social forces, has little to support it.
   Bodies aren’t just sticks that make fire when you rub them together, and
   the pain, heartache, and regret that can accompany the highs of sexual
   excitement show us that much more is at stake.

Let’s take an ordinary example: when I take the Piccadilly tube line in London,
I notice that one of the end stations is “Cockfosters,” a name which give rise to
obvious dirty association (fostering my cock). A Jungian approach would
decipher in this name a deeper urge to strengthen my potency (if I am a man),
as if sexuality is a substantial psychic passion that seeks to express itself in all
possible everyday situations. For a Lacanian, things stand the other way round:
I am (or, rather, may be) obsessed with fostering my cock because I associate
the name of the station with some traumatic or libidinally invested event which
may have nothing to do with sexuality. Another more simple example: back in
the 1960s, a Slovene pop singer Rafko Irgolič, a dentist by profession, was quite
popular in imitating the cowboy country songs. In one of them, “My black
stallion,” he sings about a young guy riding a horse which willingly takes him to
his beloved eagerly awaiting him, with the words bordering on the obscene
(“Run, run, run, runny, / sun, sun, sun, sunny, / one, one, one, onnny, how does
he race . . .”). If one listens to the (rather stupid) song, it gets immediately clear
that he is not joyfully riding the horse looking forward to the sex with his
girlfriend—it is rather the opposite, his true enjoyment resides in his riding the
black stallion, and the sex (“riding the girl”) is just a pretext that obfuscates the
true heart of his enjoyment. One can presume that, when he will actually make
love to the girl, he will be dreaming about riding his stallion . . . To put it in
another way, at its most basic level, sexuality of the unconscious phenomena
does not reside in their ultimate content but in how these phenomena are
mediated or submitted to the “dream-work,” to its detours and displacements.
   Do such detours and displacements not bring us close to poetry? Pippin is
right to remark that, in a typical modernist way, Heidegger emphasizes two things
about poetry today: since the poetic disclosure of reality is threatened, every
96                                Quantum History


authentic poetry today has to reflect upon its own possibility, has to be poetry
about poetry itself. Plus insofar as poetry is in these conditions a search for a lost
home, for a lost authentic life-world, this means that it cannot by itself achieve
this goal and outline a new meaningful disclosure of being; it can only provide
ambiguous hints: poetry “rather opens a door than shows us how to enter or what
we might find when we do.”(214) One has to go to the end here: what if such a
position in between is our final predicament? One could afford here yet another
of the reversals that characterize Heidegger’s thought (in the style of “the essence
of truth is the truth of essence itself”): the question of Being (Seinsfrage) is the
being of Question itself—every disclosure of being is an (ultimately failed) reply
to this question, a reply which conceals more than it discloses.
     So let’s take a final look at Pippin’s shift from a Hegelian position to a
Heideggerian one. In Culmination Pippin restates his old Hegelian position
that any critique of idealism which asserts its dependence upon some external
ground, “insofar as it is a thinking, a judging, a claim to know, is always already
a manifestation of a dependence on pure thinking and its conditions, and
such ‘moments’ of pure thinking are to delimit (but not limit) the normative
domain of intelligibility (what can rightly be distinguished from what, or
rightly posited as ‘ground,’ for example) and not any process or series of events
that goes on in supposed independence of the empirical world.”(149) In his
earlier works, Pippin applies this critique to Heidegger himself: Heidegger’s
assertion of the dependence of our thinking on a disclosure of Being external
to it, is also “already a manifestation of a dependence on pure thinking.”
Pippin doesn’t elevate here thinking (self-consciousness) into a causal ground
of nature and social life: science can explain how certain animals were
able to develop thinking, but they are thereby describing a certain natural
process, and

     no fact about the organic properties of such beings accounts for what it is to
     be self-conscious or agents, and there is no need for the positing of
     nonmaterial entities or capacities. Those are categories of achievement—
     indeed, collective achievement—and the question of what is achieved is an
     autonomous philosophical question.
                                                                                (158)
                    Names for Finitude: Hegel, Heidegger, Pippin                97


Spirit as a self-generative process is, of course, grounded in natural substantial
bodies, but this does not explain its immanent logic. It goes without saying that
Pippin applies the same critique to Marx and Freud: they both assert the
dependence of our thinking on some “objective” substantial process external
to it—the social productive process, the unconscious mechanisms. In The
Culmination, however, Pippin concedes that Heidegger does break out of this
circle—just Heidegger, not Marx or Freud. Heidegger’s critique of Hegel (not
Marx’s, not Freud’s limitation of consciousness) is therefore for Pippin “the
first genuine confrontation with Hegel in all the post-Hegelian European
tradition.”(161) In some sense this is true, but this confrontation is extremely
reductive: a key dimension of Hegel’s thought disappears in Heidegger’s
reading of Hegel as the culmination of metaphysical idealism in which
discursive Reason is asserted as the ultimate ground of all reality. We should
begin with the key fact that Hegel himself in some sense breaks out of the self-
enclosed logical circle when, at the end of his logic, he passes from logic to
nature: he evokes the insufficiency of the closed circle of logic, of its realm of
shadows:

   The idea is still logical; it is shut up in pure thought [in den reinen Gedanken
   eingeschlossen], the science only of the divine concept. Its systematic
   exposition is of course itself a realization, but one confined within the same
   sphere. Because the pure idea of cognition is to this extent shut up within
   subjectivity, it is the drive [Trieb] to sublate it, and pure truth becomes as
   final result also the beginning of another sphere and science.
                                                                      (SL, 12.253)

This passage is thus not an objective causal process, it is immanent to thinking
subjectivity, an effect of “a felt practical insufficiency”.(160) What post-
Hegelians from Schelling to Marx reproach Hegel with is here clearly stated by
Hegel himself. Pippin is right to point out that what Hegel means by calling the
Logic the realm of shadows is “a concession to finitude that Heidegger does not
see”(179):

   by “shadows,” Hegel means to point to the insufficiency of the Logic—even
   as a metaphysics—if considered as a stand-alone part, when considered as
98                                 Quantum History


     a speculative science. It is an abstraction, a necessary one, but its isolation
     from the system it animates, while necessary, can produce only conceptual
     shadows of the Absolute. We must see it “alive” in the development of the
     sciences of nature and in the historical development of human Geist before
     it can be fully understood.
                                                                              (180)

Here Pippin comes close to Brandom: “the Hegelian a priori for the philosophies
of nature and spirit must be a historical a priori, what is conceptually
indispensable and so not empirically disconfirmable but at a moment of
development in the investigation of nature and the developments of civil
society.”(181) However, Pippin constrains here historicity to the “philosophies
of nature and spirit,” not to logic itself. He is right to assert that the passage
from logic to Realphilosophie is not an actual deduction or the description of
an actual causal process: all that one can deduce from the immanent self-
movement of notions is that it ends up in the feeling of practical insufficiency
which gives birth to the drive to move from the logical “realm of shadows” to
actual life. For Pippin, any reality that appears in this way has to follow and fit
the space of logical categories, but where this reality comes from is not a
philosophical problem but a question of empirical sciences. From my Hegelo-
Lacanian standpoint, however, “where does this reality come from” is THE
philosophical problem, a problem that confronts us with the topic of the
pre-ontological Real, and this is why I am compelled to deal with quantum
mechanics.

       The night of the world


What cognitive sciences are telling us about consciousness is perhaps best
resumed in Anil Seth’s Being You: A New Science of Consciousness, a book
written in a clear and modest way, without the falseness and pretention that
characterizes a lot of popular scientific writing.1 Seth’s key concept is that of
controlled hallucination. Our mind models the external environment by
predicting what kind of perceptual experience is most likely to occur next,
given prior experiences, and the result is our familiar subjective world of
objects that have three-dimensional shape, size, colour, relative position,
movement, and so forth. This constructed experience is not a representation of
the world “as it actually is,” but, rather, a model that is good enough to allow us
to navigate the environment and do the things that biological beings must do
to survive and reproduce. Such a model is a “controlled hallucination” in that it
is an imaginary representation controlled or constrained by reality-as-it-is
(prediction failures demand a re-imagining, so the hallucination cannot go
wildly in any direction), but also in the sense that hallucination is the basis for
our decisions, controlling our behaviour.
   Seth’s next and crucial logical step is to extend the concept of perception of
external reality as controlled hallucination to the perception of one’s internal
reality (our inner sensations and feelings): if perceptions of external reality are
controlled hallucinations, conscious perception of our own inner states have
to work exactly the same way, and this includes our Self: our sense of selfhood
is also just a sensing of our internal state of being, and this internal sensing,
like all forms of internal sensing, is an imaginative construction, not a direct
perception of some objective reality. Buddhists concluded long ago that the

                                                                                99
100                              Quantum History


self is an illusion, and Seth has provided a scientific way of demonstrating this
point. The same holds for free will: it is a hallucinatory mode of self-perception
or, to use another popular expression, a user’s illusion.2
   As a philosopher, my first reaction to this theory concerns the status of this
theory itself: is it—and what it claims about reality—also a controlled
hallucination? If yes, why should we take it seriously as truth, as the description
of the way things “really are”? If not, how can our mind step out of controlled
manipulation? The paradox is that the very distinction between how we
perceive/hallucinate reality and how this reality is in itself is part of our
“hallucinatory” thinking (or, as Hegel put it, the distinction between for-us and
in-itself is internal to for-us). Isn’t the history of science itself the ultimate
proof of it?
                                     *
Sabine Hossenfelder has repeatedly formulated in some of her podcasts the
claim of the extreme sceptic: we cannot be absolutely sure that the outside
reality really exists, that it is not just a hallucination in my mind. I agree with
her, but also at the ontological level. What we perceive in our everyday life as
external reality is, as relativity theory and quantum mechanics have made
abundantly clear, an appearance concealing a radically different reality. We
try to formulate this different reality through modern science, but there is a
radical uncertainty inscribed into the very heart of this reality: the more we try
to reach for and grasp the real beneath our reality, the more we are dealing
with symbolic constructs which do not fit what we experience as our reality.
Just think about how in the past decades, quantum scientists have advocated
totally incompatible theories: the Many Worlds theories, repeated Big Bangs,
etc. It is as if we are cursed by a vicious cycle here: the more we want to grasp
how things “really are in themselves,” the more we get caught in intellectual
speculations.
   So my sad conclusion is that, while quantum physics provides the most
adequate insight into the universe, the only moments when we are in touch
with the Real are the moments of what Lacan called “subjective destitution”
and/or what mystics called the “night of the world,” the collapse of the symbolic
universe. So we should fearlessly reject “objective reality”: when reality dissolves
in “subjective” fragments, these fragments themselves fall back into the Real,
                              The Night of the World                          101


losing their subjective consistency. The paradox of the postmodern rejection of
consistent Self resides in its ultimate result: we lose its opposite, objective
reality itself, which gets transformed into a set of contingent subjective
constructions. A true materialist should do the opposite: refuse to accept
“objective reality” in order to undermine consistent subjectivity. The task is not
to grasp how reality is “in itself,” independently of our mind; the task is to
locate our mind itself, inclusive of its antagonisms, gaps and tensions, and
inclusive of its symbolic constructions of “objective reality,” into a historical
Real.
   Alain Badiou3 opposes mysticism and philosophy as the two modes of
approaching the unity of being and existence (for Badiou, “being” designates
the multiplicity grounded in a Void, i.e., a sphere of ontology whose modern
secular form is pure mathematics, while “existence” is a transcendental
category: a multiplicity “exists” if it has its place in a transcendental horizon
which structures a domain of being, transforming meaningless multiplicity
into an element of the order of meaning, of a potential subjective engagement).
Mysticism asserts a direct “irrational” (or, rather, pre-rational) unity of being
and existence: the unity of being as One is not constructed through a long
process of rational development (as is the case with Hegel’s logic which begins
with pure being and ends with the rational totality of absolute Idea), it is
immediately “felt” as an intuition. In other words, in mystical experience the
beginning and end directly coincide, there is no work of reason needed to
mediate them. In my view, however, a mystical experience is not that of
the direct-intuitive unity but, on the contrary, the experience of a radical
discordance, of a fall from unity, of the pure (pre-dialectical) absolute
contradiction which opens up the space for every form of rational elaboration.
Intuition of failure here paradoxically coincides with the failure of intuition.
   In this sense I endorse John Millbank’s characterization of my stance as that
of “mystic materialism”—the “mystic” dimension has nothing to do with some
obscure spiritualism, it simply points towards the “night of the world,” the
zero-level, the ground on which our universe thrives. I also want to emphasize
the conjunction of the two terms, “mystical” and “materialism”: since our
perception of external reality is always mediated by the symbolic order and
thus has the minimal status of a symbolic fiction, our only contact with what
102                               Quantum History


one cannot but naïvely call “reality as it is in itself ” occurs in mystical
experiences which brings us close to the very gap in the Real that establishes us
as subjects. We should thus totally reject the equation of an authentic mystical
experience with any kind of spiritualism: mystical experience is the only
ultimate proof against solipsism, a proof that we are not alone, that we are
embedded in material reality. To dispel the reproach that the recourse to
mysticism is foreign to Lacan, one should point out that the reference to
mysticism is a permanent feature of Lacan’s teaching. Already in his first
seminar, Lacan says about Angelus Silesius that

   the books of the Cherubinic Wanderer strike a transparent, crystalline note.
   It is one of the most significant moments in human meditation on being, a
   moment richer in resonances for me than the Dark Night of St John of the
   Cross, which everyone reads and no one understands.4

Mysticism then returns as a topic in Lacan’s Seminar XX (Encore) where he
deals with feminine sexuality. Lacan qualifies mysticism as “something serious”
and locates his own writings as within the same order as the mystical: “mystical
jaculations are neither idle chatter nor empty verbiage; they provide, all in all,
some of the best reading one can find,” with a footnote at the bottom of the
page: “Add to that list Jacques Lacan’s Écrits, because it’s of the same order.”5
How are we to understand this? Lacan said in 1969 (a year after the fateful
1968): “You are, however strange this may appear, the cause of yourself. Only
there is no self. Rather there is a divided self.”6 Lacan’s logic is here clear: objet
a is the object-cause of desire, but this weird object is the subject itself in its
objectivized form, so the subject causes itself through objet a, and the basic
division of the subject is this very division between $ and a which are the same
thing in the form of lack and excess. All the paradoxes are grounded in this
incompatibility of subject and a: a is the obstacle to my identity, a foreign stain
in me, but this very obstacle causes me as the subject of desire . . .
   In his Seminar XIV7, Lacan mentions the “weird correspondence between
subject and object” (“l’etrange correspondance entre sujet et objet”)—why is
this correspondence strange? For two interconnected reasons. First, this
correspondence is not what philosophers usually mean by the correlation
between subject and object—it is almost its opposite, a kind of negative
                             The Night of the World                         103


correlation, since subject is defined precisely by being a non-object. Subject
and object are two sides of the same coin, lack and excess; they cannot be
“synthesized” so that excess will fill in the lack because they are strictly
co-existent, one and the same thing at two different levels—if the lack were to
be filled in, there would no longer be a subject, the subject would fall into
reality as one of the objects. Second, this correspondence is not properly
dialectical but a non-dialectical foundation, a gap which opens up and sustains
the very space of dialectics, in some sense even its non-dialectical
presupposition . . .
   To clarify this crucial point, one should venture into the notion of a Thing
which is not a part of our (transcendentally constituted) reality. In Die Frage
nach dem Ding, his treatise on Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason,8 Heidegger
restricts himself to “thing” in the sense of an empirical object, part of our
transcendentally-constituted reality, without mentioning the Thing in the
more radical Freud-Lacanian sense needed: the pre-ontological Real, the
“immortal” horror not bound by finitude, a feature of imagination prior to
fantasy, like Maupassant’s horla or the alien from Ridley Scott’s film of the
same name. We should delineate here the two opposed philosophical senses of
imagination. In Kant, imagination is a synthetic activity which is necessary for
reality to manifest itself, a medium in which sensory data and pure reason
come together—to quote Ulisses Razzante Vaccari: “This conciliatory function
of imagination shows, via a synthesizing action, how the manifold may be then
connected by knowledge as it pervades the manifold of the sensitive data and
makes it available to the synthetic unity of apperception.”9 Imagination is thus
transcendental, constitutive even of our perception of actual objects, and
Heidegger focuses on this, reading imagination as pre-discursive Manifestness.
In Lacan’s terms, we could read this imagination as the fantasmatic support of
reality.
   In Hegel, imagination at its most radical is pre-ontological, the violent
activity of tearing things apart, the infinite power of abstraction. One cannot
avoid mentioning two often quoted passages, the first one from Jenaer
Realphilosophie and the second one from the “Foreword” to Phenomenology.
There is nothing more foreign to Hegel than the lamentation of the richness
of reality that gets lost when we proceed to its conceptual grasping—recall
104                              Quantum History


Hegel’s already-quoted unambiguous celebration of the absolute power of
Understanding:

   what is thus separated, and in a sense is unreal, is itself an essential moment;
   for just because the concrete fact is self-divided, and turns into unreality, it
   is something self-moving, self-active. The action of separating the elements
   is the exercise of the force of Understanding, the most astonishing and
   greatest of all powers, or rather the absolute power. The circle, which is self-
   enclosed and at rest, and, qua substance, holds its own moments, is an
   immediate relation, the immediate, continuous relation of elements with
   their unity, and hence arouses no sense of wonderment. But that an accident
   as such, when cut loose from its containing circumference,—that what is
   bound and held by something else and actual only by being connected with
   it,—should obtain an existence all its own, gain freedom and independence
   on its own account—this is the portentous power of the negative; it is the
   energy of thought, of pure Self.10

This celebration is in no way qualified, i.e., Hegel’s point is not that this power
is nonetheless later “sublated” into a subordinate moment of the unifying
totality of Reason. The problem with Understanding is rather that it does not
unleash this power to its fullest, that it takes it as external to the thing itself—
like, in the above-quoted passage from Phenomenology, the standard notion
that it is merely our Understanding (“mind”) that separates in its imagination
what in “reality” belongs together, so that the Understanding’s “absolute power”
is merely the power of our imagination which in no way concerns the reality
of the thing so analyzed. We pass from Understanding to Reason not when this
analyzing, tearing apart, is overcome in a synthesis which brings us back to the
wealth of reality, but when this power of “tearing apart” is displaced from
“merely our mind” into things themselves, as their inherent power of negativity.
In this way, the dimension of the Imaginary returns in its grounding role, not
as the site of imaginary identifications and self-recognition but as a (possible)
name for the violent act of dismembering (the production of le corps morcele
with its membra disjecta) which tears apart every organic unity. In a move
further from Kant, imagination is asserted not just as synthesis but also as
“analysis,” the activity of tearing apart what seemed to belong together. Hegel
                                The Night of the World                             105


formulated this process in his Jenaer Realphilosophie, where he writes about
the “Night of the World”:

   The human being is this night, this empty nothing, that contains everything
   in its simplicity—an unending wealth of many representations, images,
   of which none belongs to him—or which are not present. This night,
   the interior of nature, that exists here—pure self—in phantasmagorical
   representations, is night all around it, in which here shoots a bloody head—
   there another white ghastly apparition, suddenly here before it, and just so
   disappears. One catches sight of this night when one looks human beings in
   the eye—into a night that becomes awful.11

One should not be blinded by the poetic power of this description, but read it
precisely. The first thing to note is how the objects which freely float around in
this “night of the world” are membra disjecta, partial objects, objects detached
from their organic Whole—is there not a strange echo between this description
and Hegel’s description of the negative power of Understanding which is able
to abstract an entity (a process, a property) from its substantial context and
treat it as if it has an existence of its own? It is thus as if, in the ghastly scenery
of the “night of the world,” we encounter something like the power of
Understanding in its natural state, spirit in the guise of a proto-spirit—this,
perhaps, is the most precise definition of horror: when a higher state of
development violently inscribes itself in the lower state, in its ground/
presupposition, where it cannot but appear as a monstrous mess, a disintegration
of order, a terrifying unnatural combination of natural elements. This is why
for Hegel madness is not an accidental lapse, distortion, “illness” of human
spirit, but something which is inscribed into the individual spirit’s basic
ontological constitution: to be a human means to be potentially mad:

   This interpretation of insanity as a necessarily occurring form or stage
   in the development of the soul is naturally not to be understood as if
   we were asserting that every mind, every soul, must go through this stage
   of extreme derangement. Such an assertion would be as absurd as to
   assume that because in the Philosophy of Right crime is considered as a
   necessary manifestation of the human will, therefore to commit crime is an
   inevitable necessity for every individual. Crime and insanity are extremes
106                                Quantum History


   which the human mind in general has to overcome in the course of its
   development.12

Although not a factual necessity, madness is a formal possibility constitutive of
the human mind: it is something whose threat has to be overcome if we are to
emerge as “normal” subjects, which means that “normality” can only arise as
the overcoming of this threat. This is why, as Hegel put it a couple of pages
later, “insanity must be discussed before the healthy, intellectual consciousness,
although it has that consciousness for its presupposition.”13 In short, we do not
all have to be mad in reality, but madness is the real of our psychic lives, a point
to which our psychic lives necessarily refer in order to assert themselves as
“normal.”
   Do we encounter this Real of madness as what Heidegger calls “the forgetting
of the meaning of being”? This forgetting heralds “ ‘the age of complete
meaninglessness.’ So, any retrieval of the question must be a path towards a
renewed meaningfulness of being.”(34) But what if metaphysics is precisely
the stance of (not just “letting be” what is there in its meaninglessness but) a
desperate search to find a meaning that sustains beings? So how does the
horizon of meaningfulness/disclosure relate to Sartre’s nausea? Is nausea
simply the traumatic experience of being outside a disclosure of meaning? It’s
not so simple: the disgusting thick absurd presence is not reality in itself, it
remains fully subjective in its substantiality—the true in-itself closer to
quantum waves, their pure non-substantial oscillations? Here is a key passage
from Sartre’s Nausea:

   This moment was extraordinary. I was there, motionless, paralyzed, plunged
   in a horrible ecstasy. But at the heart of this ecstasy, something new had just
   appeared; I understood the nausea, I possessed it. To tell the truth, I did not
   formulate my discoveries to myself. But I think it would be easy for me to put
   them in words now. The essential point is contingency. I mean that by
   definition existence is not necessity. To exist is simply . . . to be there; existences
   appear, let themselves be encountered, but you can never deduce them.14

Sartre is here at the opposite end of Andrei Tarkovsky whose films enact the
impossible combination, divine experience in disgusting wet mud. We should
                                The Night of the World                            107


thus banish the fear that, once we ascertain that reality is the infinitely divisible,
substanceless void within a void, “matter will disappear.” What the digital
information revolution, the biogenetic revolution, and the quantum revolution
in physics all share is that they mark the reemergence of what, for want of a
better term, I am tempted to call postmetaphysical idealism. It is as if Chesterton’s
insight into how the materialist struggle for the full assertion of reality, against
its subordination to any “higher” metaphysical order, culminates in the loss of
reality itself: what began as the assertion of material reality in modern sciences
ended up in the realm of pure formulas of quantum physics. Is this really,
however, a form of idealism? Since the radical materialist stance asserts that
there is no World, that the World in its Whole is Nothing, materialism has
nothing to do with the presence of damp, dense matter—its proper figures are,
rather, constellations in which matter seems to “disappear,” like the pure
oscillations of superstrings or quantum vibrations. On the contrary, if we see
in raw, inert matter more than an imaginary screen, we always secretly endorse
some kind of spiritualism.
   As we have just seen, the supreme expression of such spiritual materialism
are the films of Andrei Tarkovsky: when one of their heroes has a spiritual
experience, it is not by way of an effort to elevate himself above the earthly
reality, gazing up towards heaven or a distant horizon; on the contrary, he lies
flat on humid earth, soaking his face in mud and dirty water . . . Needless to
add that such spiritualization of matter is the very opposite of the basic stance
of modern science in which “matter” is also “spiritualized,” but in a totally
different way: matter becomes an abstraction formalized in mathematical
formulas. Here we encounter another crucial aspect of the opposition between
idealism and materialism: materialism is not the assertion of inert material
density in its humid heaviness—such a “materialism” can always serve as a
support for gnostic spiritualist obscurantism. In contrast, a true materialism
joyously assumes the “disappearance of matter,” the fact that there is only void.
So what if we turn around the perspective and celebrate the exit from direct
being-in-the-world, the shift from engaged care to cold observation of
Vorhandenes, as a big achievement which opens up the path to modern science?
   Another mode of such pre-ontological Real can be provided at the vocal
level. In the opening sequence of David Lynch’s Blue Velvet15, we hear the
108                              Quantum History


uncanny noise that emerges when we approach the real. This noise is difficult
to locate in reality. In order to determine its status, one is tempted to evoke
contemporary cosmology which speaks of noises at the borders of the universe;
these noises are not simply internal to the universe—they are remainders or
last echoes of the Big Bang that created the universe itself. The ontological
status of this noise is more interesting than it may appear, since it subverts the
fundamental notion of the “open,” infinite universe that defines the space of
Newtonian physics. That is to say, the modern notion of the “open” universe is
based on the hypothesis that every positive entity (noise, matter) occupies
some (empty) space; it hinges on the difference between space as void and
positive entities which occupy it, “fill it out.” Space is here phenomenologically
conceived as something that exists prior to the entities which “fill it out.” If we
destroy or remove the matter that occupies a given space, this space as void
remains. The primordial noise, the last remainder of the Big Bang, is on the
contrary constitutive of space itself: it is not a noise “in” space but a noise that
keeps space open as such. If, therefore, we were to erase this noise, we would
not get the “empty space” which was filled out by it. Space itself, the receptacle
for every “inner-worldly” entity, would vanish. This noise is, in a sense, the
“sound of silence.”
   Along the same lines, the fundamental noise in Lynch’s films is not simply
caused by objects that are part of reality; rather, it forms the ontological horizon
or frame of reality itself, i.e., the texture that holds reality together. Were this
noise to be eradicated, reality itself would collapse, from the “open” infinite
universe of Cartesian-Newtonian physics, we are thus back to the pre-modern
“closed” universe, encircled, bounded, by a fundamental “noise.” We encounter
this same noise in the nightmare sequence of The Elephant Man. It transgresses
the borderline that separates interior from exterior, i.e., the extreme externality
of a machine uncannily coincides with the utmost intimacy of the bodily
interior, with the rhythm of heart palpitations. This noise also appears after the
camera enters the hole in the elephant-man’s hood, which stands for the gaze.
The reversal of reality into the real corresponds to the reversal of the look (the
subject looking at reality) into gaze, i.e., it occurs when we enter the “black
hole,” the crack in the texture of reality. And it seems that there is no space for
such pre-ontological real in Heidegger’s thought. For Heidegger, metaphysics
                                The Night of the World                            109


   ultimately means that being must be understood as what could be the
   content of an assertion. The meaning of Being is then understood to be
   intelligibility or knowability, and the corresponding notion of truth is what
   Heidegger calls “correctness,” correspondence with the beings about which
   assertoric claims are made.
                                                                                 (70)

But is then openness/disclosure primordial with regard to logos? Is truth as
aletheia prior to truth as adequatio of predicative statements to reality? Yes, but
it is not prior to language itself: there is a pre-predicative mode of language,
which is why language is “the house of Being.” Hegel also complicates things
here: speculative statement has to be read twice, its truth emerges only through
its failure, since its enunciation is inscribed into its enunciated content. Can we
then say that if disclosure only happens when language is not just designating
something but fails in this—or, to put it in more formal terms, that differentiality
includes pure difference? This is why for Hegel true thinking means thinking
in language against language, this is why he regularly resorts to word-plays and
(from the standpoint of language rules) “meaningless” misreadings.
   Although Heidegger is the ultimate transcendental philosopher, there are
mysterious passages where he ventures into this pre-transcendental domain.
In the elaboration of this notion of an untruth [ethe] older than the very
dimension of truth, Heidegger emphasizes how man’s “stepping into the
essential unfolding of truth” is a “transformation of the being of man in the
sense of a derangement [Ver-rueckung—going mad] of his position among
beings.”16 The “derangement” to which Heidegger refers is, of course, not a
psychological or clinical category of madness: it signals a much more radical,
properly ontological reversal/aberration, when, in its very foundation, the
universe itself is in a way “out of joint,” thrown off its rails. What is crucial here
is to remember that Heidegger wrote these lines in the years of his intensive
reading of Schelling’s Treatise on Human Freedom, a text which discerns the
origin of Evil precisely in a kind of ontological madness, in the “derangement”
of man’s position among beings (his self-centeredness), as a necessary
intermediate step (“vanishing mediator”) in the passage from “prehuman
nature” to our symbolic universe: “man, in his very essence, is a katastrophe—a
110                             Quantum History


reversal that turns him away from the genuine essence. Man is the only
catastrophe in the midst of beings.”17
   However, at this crucial point where in some sense everything is decided,
we should make a step further with regard to Heidegger’s formulation—“a
derangement of his position among beings”—a step indicated by some other
formulations of Heidegger himself. It may appear clear what Heidegger aims at
by the quoted formulation: man as Da-Sein (the “being-there” of Being, the
place of the disclosure of Being) is an entity irreducibly rooted in his body (I
use here the masculine form since it is at work in Heidegger). With a little bit
of rhetorical exaggeration, one can say that Heidegger’s “no Being without
Being-There as the place of its disclosure” is his version of Hegel’s “one should
grasp the Absolute not only as Substance but also as Subject.” However, if the
disclosure of the entire domain of entities is rooted in a singular entity, then
something “deranged” is taking place: a particular entity is the exclusive site at
which all entities appear, acquire their Being—so, to put it brutally, you kill
a man and you simultaneously “kill Being” . . . This short-circuit between
the Clearance of Being and a particular entity introduces a catastrophic
derangement into the order of beings: because man, rooted in his body, cannot
look at entities from outside, every disclosure of Being, every Clearance, has to
be grounded in untruth (concealment/hiddenness). The ultimate cause of the
derangement that pertains to Da-Sein thus resides in the fact that Dasein is by
definition embodied, and, towards the end of his life, Heidegger conceded that,
for philosophy, “the body phenomenon is the most difficult problem”:

   The bodily [das Leibliche] in the human is not something animalistic. The
   manner of understanding that accompanies it is something that metaphysics
   up till now has not touched on.18

One is tempted to risk the hypothesis that it is precisely the psychoanalytic
theory which was the first to touch on this key question: is not the Freudian
eroticized body, sustained by libido, organized around erogenous zones,
precisely the non-animalistic, non-biological body? Is it not this (and not the
animalistic) body that is the proper object of psychoanalysis? Heidegger totally
misses this dimension when in his Zollikoner Seminare, he dismisses Freud as
a causal determinist:
                              The Night of the World                          111


   He postulates for the conscious human phenomena that they can be
   explained without gaps, i.e., the continuity of causal connections. Since
   there are no such connections “in the consciousness,” he has to invent “the
   unconscious,” in which there have to be the causal links without gaps.19

This interpretation may appear correct: it could be said that Freud tries to
discover a causal order in what appears to our consciousness as a confused and
contingent array of mental facts (slips of the tongue, dreams, clinical symptoms)
and, in this way, to close the chain of causal links that run our psyche. However,
Heidegger completely misses the way the Freudian “unconscious” is grounded in
the traumatic encounter of an Otherness whose intrusion precisely breaks,
interrupts, the continuity of the causal link: what we get in the “unconscious” is
not a complete, uninterrupted, causal link, but the repercussions, the after-
shocks, of traumatic interruptions. What Freud calls “symptoms” are ways to
deal with a traumatic rupture, while “fantasy” is a formation destined to cover up
this cut. That’s why for Heidegger a finite human being a priori cannot reach the
inner peace and calm of Buddhist Enlightenment (nirvana). A world is disclosed
to us against the background of an ontological catastrophe: “man is the only
catastrophe in the midst of beings.” Or, as Heidegger would have put it, there is
no Being (Seyn) without Being-There (Dasein) as the place at which Being is
disclosed. This is why we should reject reading the Oriental thought through
Heidegger. Such an approach has to overlook the basic feature of Dasein, finitude
and being-thrown into an historically determined mode of the disclosure of
being which is not grounded in any transcendent ultimate Foundation (divine
Will, evolutionary laws of the universe . . .)—it is in its innermost an “event,”
something that epochally occurs, takes place, “just happens.”
   It was William Richardson who, drawing on his unique knowledge of
Heidegger and Lacan, stated that “when I hear Heidegger talk about lethe as
‘older’ than the essence of truth, I hear what Lacan means by the real.” Heidegger
himself, in the elaboration of this notion of an untruth older than the very
dimension of truth, emphasizes how man’s “stepping into the essential
unfolding of truth” is a “transformation of the being of man in the sense of a
derangement [Ver-rueckung] of his position among beings.” Erring/untruth is
the innermost feature of the event of truth itself, and the very opening
112                               Quantum History


paragraph of John Sallis’s remarkable essay on the monstrosity of truth directly
tackles this difficult point: “What if truth were monstrous? What if it were
monstrosity itself, the very condition, the very form, of everything monstrous,
everything deformed? But, first of all, itself essentially deformed, monstrous in
its very essence? What if there were within the very essence of truth something
essentially other than truth, a divergence from nature within nature, true
monstrosity?”20 We are as far as imaginable here from the inner peace acquired
in any form of Hindu or Buddhist meditation.
   But, again, here we have to risk a step further: if man is the only catastrophe,
does this mean that, prior to the arrival of humanity, there was no catastrophe, that
nature was a balanced order derailed only by human hubris? (By catastrophe
I don’t mean ontic disasters like asteroids hitting the earth but more radical
derangement of the entire network of forms of life.) The problem is that if man is
the only catastrophe “in the midst of beings,” and if beings are only disclosed to us
as humans, then the very space of non-catastrophic beings that surround humans
is already ontologically grounded in the catastrophe that is the rise of man.
   Now we face the key question: is man as the only catastrophe in the midst
of beings an exception, so that if we assume the impossible point-of-view of
looking at the universe from a safe distance, we see a universal texture of
beings just not deranged by catastrophes (since man is a catastrophe only from
his own standpoint, as the exception that grounds his access to beings)? In this
case, we are back at the Kantian position: reality “in itself,” outside the Clearing
within which it appears to us, is unknowable, we can only speculate about it the
way Heidegger himself does it when he plays with the idea that there is a kind
of ontological pain in nature itself. Or should we take Heidegger’s speculation
seriously, so that the catastrophe is not only man but already nature in itself,
and in man as the being-of-speech this catastrophe that grounds reality in
itself only comes to word? (Quantum physics offers its own version of a
catastrophe that grounds reality: the broken symmetry, the disturbance of the
void by quantum oscillations; theosophical speculations offers another version:
the self-division or Fall of Godhead itself which gives birth to our world.)
   Now we are on theological ground. Fredric Jameson was right to proclaim
predestination the most interesting theological concept for Marxism:
                               The Night of the World                         113


predestination indicates the retroactive causality which characterizes a
properly dialectical historical process. In a similar way, we should not be afraid
to search for the traces of a meta-transcendental (dialectical materialist)
approach in the theosophical speculations of Meister Eckhart, Jacob Boehme
or F.W.J. Schelling. For a Kantian, of course, such speculations are nothing
more than empty Schwarmerei, enthusiastic bla-bla about nothing, while for
us, it is only here that we touch the Real.21
   If we endorse this option, then we have to draw the only possible conclusion:
every image or construction of “objective reality,” of the way it is in itself,
“independently of us,” is one of the ways being is disclosed to us, and is as such
already in some basic sense “anthropocentric,” grounded in (and at the same
time obfuscating) the catastrophe that constitutes us. The main candidate for
getting close to how reality is “in itself ” are formulas of relativity theory and
quantum physics—the result of complex experimental and intellectual work to
which nothing corresponds in our direct experience of reality . . . The only
“contact” we have with the Real “independent of us” is our very separation
from it, the radical derangement, what Heidegger calls catastrophe. The
paradox is that what unites us with the Real “in itself ” is the very gap that we
experience as our separation from it. (The same goes for Christianity where
the only way to experience unity with god is to identify with Christ suffering
on the cross, i.e., with the point at which god is divided from himself.) And this
dynamic of experiencing the gap itself as the point of unity is the basic feature
of Hegel’s dialectic—which is why the space beyond Heidegger’s thought that
we designated as the space beyond the transcendental is the space to which
Hegelian thought belongs. This is also the space for thinking which cannot be
reduced to positive science—and in this space, the danger of falling into New
Age obscurantism is omnipresent. Since one can easily ignore the possibility
that a divinity will directly and openly appear to us, humans, in a way that will
leave no doubts about whom we are dealing with, one cannot but concur with
Cixin Liu, author of The Three-Body Problem, when he said that he would like
people to grapple with what he thinks is the “greatest uncertainty facing
humanity”—the potential that there is life on other planets and that we could
make contact with them at any time.

   I hope they realize that there’s this one thing that may not happen for the
   next 10,000 years, or it may happen tomorrow morning . . . And that once
   it happens, our world and our lives will change completely. I hope that the
   series of 3 Body Problem will make people look up at the starry sky from
   their busy and trivial lives, even if it’s just for a moment.22

I recently stumbled upon a rather imbecilic Rightist podcast against Hegel23
which nonetheless gets one thing right: the origin of the entire line of thought
from Hegel to Marx and Communism resides in the Rhine mystics, from
Meister Eckhart to Jacob Boehme. In contrast to previous (and later) mystics
(like the neo-Platonists) who practice the bottom-up approach (our material
reality emerges through the gradual process of the fall from the supreme divine
Absolute), the Rhine mystics practice a top-down: their starting point is
humans as fallen beings since god himself needs humans to become actual god
(although—or, rather, precisely because—humans stand for fall, sin)—as
Eckhart put it: not only is god the origin of man but god in his full actuality is
at the same time born in man. Of especial significance here is Jacob Boehme
whom Hegel described as “the first German philosopher.” Boehme asserts the
embrace of the Ungrund, the Nothing considered as a pure ungrounding—it
is this nothing which generates a tragedy in God Himself, and in so doing
generates in the divine justice the tragedy of its own undoing in actuality.
Every thing, from the Godhead down, is comprehended as enclosing within it
already the seed of its undoing.
   The notion of the Ungrund, of the abyss, without foundation, dark and
irrational, prior to being, is an attempt to provide an answer to the basic
question of all questions, the question concerning the origin of the world and
of the arising of evil. The Ungrund is interwoven freedom: it is impossible to
separate them, the Ungrund as a primordial freedom is indeterminate even by
God. Boehme’s teaching about the Ungrund and freedom is an attempt to
comprehend the world-creation from the inner life of the Divinity: the world-
creation bears a relationship to the inner life of the Divine Trinity, and cannot
be for It something completely external. The principle of evil thus acquires an
actual seriousness and tragic aspect. Boehme senses God not only as love, but
also as anger, wrath. He senses within God a poignant and harsh quality: the
                               The Night of the World                          115


God of the Old Testament is wrath, while Christ is love. Boehme preaches a
torment in the dark abyss, which the light of Christ has to conquer.
   Badiou perceptively turns around the theological premise that god created
the world out of nothing: “in the theological discourse this is how God created
the world: out of nothing. But I’d still say that the greatest example of creation
ex nihilo is the creation of God. It was God, rather than the world, that was
created out of nothing! Because if God had existed, the creation of the world
wouldn’t have been a problem. God is, by definition, limitless. His power is
infinite, so he could well have created something out of nothing. The problem
lies rather with us: how could we, poor finite, mortal humans, create something
out of nothing?”24 My putative reply to this claim is: but god as infinitely
powerful precisely could NOT create something out of nothing (if we ignore
the thesis that “nothing” is not just nothing but an unformed mass, like Plato’s
chora). God as infinitely powerful stands for unconditional actuality where
there is no space for creation—in the Talmud we can already read that god
should first contract himself and create the nothing itself, and this contraction
is a kind of self-limitation of god.
   So, to resume, out of nature god is the Nothing; for from out of nature is the
Nothing, which is an eye of eternity, a groundless eye, which stands nowhere
nor sees, for it is the Ungrund and the selfsame eye is a will, i.e., a longing for
manifestation, to discern the Nothing. But this is a Nothing which is “a hunger
to be something.” And together with this the Ungrund is freedom. Within the
darkness of the Ungrund there is ablaze a fire and this is freedom, a freedom
pregnant with potential. Freedom is contrary to nature, but nature has issued
forth from freedom. Freedom is a semblance of the Nothing, but from it issues
something.25 What this means is that, in what is effectively a proto-Hegelian
move, the gap that separates god from the fallen world is transposed into god
himself, as the irreducible gap between god and the Nothing, the dark abyss
that precedes him.
   It is against this background that we should appreciate Peter Sloterdijk’s
reply to my brutal question about how he relates to god: “It wasn’t me who
abandoned god, god abandoned me, he pushed me away, he lost interest in
me.”26 This statement is far from a joke, it has to be taken very seriously even
(or even especially) by an atheist: becoming an atheist is not a simple subjective
116                              Quantum History


free decision, my entire symbolic space is transformed—or, to repeat Deleuze,
you can only choose (to drop god) if you are already chosen (i.e., if god dropped
you). Abandoning god is thus at its most basic not a primordial act but a
reaction to “being abandoned by god.” And this is what the naïve surface level
of Enlightenment thought doesn’t see: in order for us to enter the space of
rational argumentation, something has to happen in the space of the big Other
in which we dwell—this is a crucial moment of the dialectics of Enlightenment.
   So what is the solution? In 1990, the Yugoslav rock band Riblja Čorba (Fish
Broth) published a song “Tito je vaš (Tito Is Yours)”. Although the title ironically
subverted the official slogan “Mi smo Titovi / Tito je naš (We are Tito’s / Tito is
ours,” there was no direct attack on Tito in the lyrics, just an irreverent
enumeration of his characteristics (“Comrade Tito was not a human creature
/ Comrade Tito had a White Court / Comrade Tito was a good comrade / And
he didn’t make us indebted . . .”). The song was in itself totally incompatible
with the official celebration of Tito, but opinions varied widely about how
critical the song was since it contained no direct denunciation of Tito as a
criminal Communist dictator. However, this debate totally missed the point:
the last lines of the song—“Tito is yours / and you are Tito’s / and I am not
guilty for that”—clearly formulate the position of externality implied by the
irreverent enumeration of Tito’s characteristics. Such an externality is much
more radical than a dissident critique of Tito which continues to participate in
the struggle between those who are for Tito and those who are against him,
while the final lines of the song are a kind of negation of negation: we are
simply outside the space of the conflict. Such a stance is needed more than
ever today.



                       The Violence of Truth

However, to avoid here a fatal misunderstanding, standing outside the space of
the conflict does not involve a peaceful neutrality elevated above the conflict:
this outside can only be reached through an act of extreme violence, of negating
the common space shared by both sides of a conflict. The standard liberal
motto apropos violence—it is sometimes necessary to resort to it, but it is
                                The Night of the World                            117


never legitimate—is not sufficient: from the radical emancipatory perspective,
one should turn this motto around. For the oppressed, violence is always
legitimate (since their very status is the result of the violence they are exposed
to), but never necessary—it is always a matter of strategic consideration to use
violence against the enemy or not.27 What does this amount to? Patrick Stewart
(a Left-wing Socialist actor who superbly played Lenin in the 1974 TV series
Fall of Eagles) says as Lenin (and the imagined words fit the real Lenin
perfectly):

   Objectively, the enemy can be your best friend, your lover, your party
   colleague, the chairman of your local branch, the editor of your party
   journal. The battle that’s coming now is not with the tsar, it is with ourselves.28

I first misread these lines, reading them not the way they are obviously meant,
as a globalized suspicion (“your enemy can be even your best friend, one
among your closest circle”), but in the opposite sense: your greatest friend is
the one whom you perceive as your enemy. However, my misreading also
delivers its own truth: since the goal of revolutionary activity is to bring about
actual revolution (taking power), the enemy’s actions which unwittingly create
conditions for the revolution are very helpful. That’s why Lenin was horrified
by Stolypin’s reforms, which included granting the right of private land
ownership to the peasantry and which led to unprecedented growth and
reform of the Russian state, thus postponing the revolution for which Lenin
was hoping for decades. Lenin was relieved by Stolypin’s death: he immediately
grasped that the final result of his reforms would have been a satisfied peasant
class with no will to engage in revolutionary activity. Stolypin was thus the true
enemy, and the hardliners who canceled his reforms after his death were
objectively our friends . . .
   The point is thus not to engage in unconstrained physical violence but to tell
the truth, aussprechen was ist, “state the facts”(Lenin), to unleash the violence
of words which shatter and mobilize people. The actual political violence that
may follow should be practiced in a Gandhian way, taking into account all the
usual humanitarian considerations—but no such constraints hold for the
Word at its beginning. Consider what happened in late July 2024 when a
number of ministers and Members of Knesset, as well as journalists and TV
118                                  Quantum History


commentators, criticized a raid by the IDF’s military police on the Sde Teiman
base in the south of Israel, in which it arrested a number of reservists accused
of abusing imprisoned Palestinians.29 These arrests, which also triggered large
public protests in Israel, happened after, horrified at what they saw, some Israeli
reservists heroically rendered public that, among other forms of abuse, the
security personnel on the Sde Teiman base was torturing Palestinian prisoners
by pushing metal sticks into their rectum, which made some of them bleed
to death. Beyond the hideous, inexcusable behaviour perpetrated by “the
only democracy in the Middle East,” there is the fact that the entire affair
was downplayed, almost ignored, in our big Western media. This willful
ignorance—the very opposite of simply not knowing it—sounds the death
knell of the Western liberal democracy. Democracy will have to be reinvented—
by violence, if necessary.
                                           *
In the history of radical politics, violence is usually associated with the so-called
Jacobin legacy which, for this very reason, is dismissed as something that
should be abandoned if we are truly to begin from the beginning again. Even
many of today’s (post-)Marxists are embarrassed by the so-called Jacobin
legacy of centralized state terror, and want to free Marx from it, proposing an
authentic good “liberal” Marx who was later obfuscated by Lenin—it is, so the
story goes, Lenin who (re)introduced into Marxism the Jacobin legacy, thus
falsifying Marx’s libertarian spirit . . . But is it so? Let us take a closer look at
how the Jacobins effectively opposed the recourse to a majority vote on behalf
of those who talk on behalf of the eternal Truth (how “totalitarian” . . .). How
could Jacobins, the partisans of unity and of the struggle against factions and
divisions, justify this rejection?

   The entire difficulty resides in how to distinguish between the voice of
   truth, even if it is minoritary, and the factional voice which seeks only to
   divide artificially to conceal the truth.30

Robespierre’s answer is: the truth is irreducible to number (counting), it can be
experienced also in solitude: those who proclaim a truth they experienced
should not be considered as factionists, but as sensible and courageous people.
In this case of attesting the truth, he said in the Assemblee on December 28,
                               The Night of the World                           119


1792, any invocation of majority or minority is nothing but a means to “reduce
to silence those whom one designated by this term ‘minority’ ”: “Minority has
everywhere an eternal right: to render audible the voice of truth.” It is deeply
significant that Robespierre made this statement in the course of the Assemblee
nationale apropos the trial of the king. Girondins proposed a “democratic”
solution: in such a difficult case, one should make an “appeal to the people”:
one should convoke local assemblies all around France and ask them to vote
on how to deal with the king, only such a move will give legitimacy to the trial.
Robespierre’s answer was that such an “appeal to the people” effectively cancels
the sovereign will of the people which, through the insurrection and revolution,
had already made itself known and changed the very nature of the French
state, bringing about the Republic.
   Robespierre’s argumentation effectively points forward to Lenin who, in his
writings of 1917, saves his utmost acerbic irony for those who engage in the
endless search for some kind of “guarantee” for the revolution. This guarantee
assumes two main forms: either the reified notion of social Necessity (one should
not risk the revolution too early; one has to wait for the right moment, when the
situation is “mature” with regard to the laws of historical development: “it is too
early for the Socialist revolution, the working class is not yet mature”) or the
normative (“democratic”) legitimacy (“the majority of the population is not on
our side, so the revolution would not really be democratic”)—as Lenin repeatedly
puts it, as if, before the revolutionary agent risks the seizure of the state power,
it should get the permission from some figure of the big Other (organize a
referendum which will ascertain that the majority supports the revolution).
   With Lenin, as with Lacan, a revolution ne s’autorise que d’elle-meme: one
should assume the revolutionary act not covered by the big Other—the fear of
taking power “prematurely,” the search for the guarantee, is the fear of the abyss
of the act. Therein resides the ultimate dimension of what Lenin incessantly
denounces as “opportunism,” and his wager is that “opportunism” is a position
which is in itself, inherently, false, masking the fear to accomplish the act with
the protective screen of “objective” facts, laws, or norms, which is why the first
step in combating it is to announce it clearly: “What, then, is to be done? We
must aussprechen was ist, ‘state the facts,’ admit the truth that there is a
tendency, or an opinion, in our Central Committee . . .”31
120                             Quantum History


   Especially when we are dealing with “strong truths” (les verities fortes),
shattering insights, pronouncing them entails symbolic violence. When la
patrie est en danger, Robespierre said, one should fearlessly state the fact that
“the nation is betrayed. This truth is now known to all Frenchmen”: “Lawgivers,
the danger is immanent; the reign of truth has to begin: we are courageous
enough to tell you this; be courageous enough to hear it.” In such a situation,
there is no space for a neutral third position—in his speech celebrating the
dead of the August 10, 1792, abbe Gregoire evoked the proverb:

   there are people who are so good that they are worthless; and in a revolution
   which engages in the struggle of freedom against despotism, a neutral man
   is a pervert who, without any doubt, waits for how the battle will turn out to
   decide which side to take.

Before we dismiss these lines as “totalitarian,” let us recall a later example
when the French patrie was en danger: the situation after the French defeat in
1940 when none other than general de Gaulle, in his famous radio address
from London, announced to the French people the “strong truth” (France is
defeated, but the war is not over) Against the Petainist collaborators. When de
Gaulle, in his historic act, refused to acknowledge the capitulation to Germans
and continued to resist, he claimed that it was only he, not the Vichy regime,
who spoke on behalf of the true France (on behalf of true France as such, not
on behalf of the “majority of the French”!), what he was saying was deeply true
even if it was “democratically” not only without legitimization but clearly
opposed to the opinion of the majority of the French people. (And the same
goes for Germany: it was the tiny minority actively resisting Hitler which stood
for Germany, not the active Nazis and also not the undecided opportunists.)
   There is no reason to despise democratic elections; the point is only to insist
that there are not per se an indication of Truth—as a rule, they tend to reflect
the predominant doxa determined by the hegemonic ideology. There can be
democratic elections which enact an event of Truth—the election in which,
against the sceptic-cynical inertia, the majority momentarily “awakens” and
votes against the hegemonic ideological opinion; however, the very exceptional
status of such a surprising electoral result proves that elections as such are not
a medium of Truth.
                                The Night of the World                            121


   This position of a minority which stands for All is more than ever actual
today, in our post-political epoch in which the plurality of opinions reigns:
under such conditions, the universal Truth is by definition a minority position.
As Sophie Wahnich points out, in a democracy corrupted by media, this is what
“the freedom of the press without the duty to resist” amounts to: “The right to
say anything in a political relativism instead of a demanding and sometimes
even lethal ethics of truth.” In such a situation, the uncompromisingly-insisting
voice of truth (about ecology, about biogenetics, about AI, about the excluded
. . .) cannot but appear as “irrational” in its lack of consideration for the opinions
of others, in its refusal of the spirit of pragmatic compromises, in its apocalyptic
finality.
   What grounds a truth is the experience of suffering and courage, sometimes
in solitude, not the number and force of majority. This, of course, does
not mean that there are infallible criteria for the truth: the assertion of
Truth involves a kind of wager, a risky decision, one should carve out its
path, sometimes even enforce it. Those who tell the truth are as a rule not
understood at first, they struggle (also with themselves) and seek for the
proper language to tell it. It is the full recognition of this dimension of risk
and wager, of the absence of any external guarantee, which distinguishes
the authentic truth-engagement from any form of “totalitarianism” or
“fundamentalism.”
   But, again: how are we to distinguish clearly this “ethics of truth” from the
sectarian attempts to impose one’s own position upon all others? How can we
be sure that the voice of the minoritarian “part of no-part” is effectively the
voice of universal truth and not merely a particular grievance? The first thing
to bear in mind here is that the truth we are dealing with is not “objective”
truth, but the self-relating truth about one’s own subjective position; as such,
this truth is an engaged truth, measured not by its factual accuracy but by the
way it affects the subjective position of enunciation. In his Seminar 18 on “a
discourse which would not be of a semblance,” Lacan provided a succinct
definition of the truth of interpretation in psychoanalysis: “Interpretation is
not tested by a truth that would decide by yes or no, it unleashes truth as such.
It is only true inasmuch as it is truly followed.” There is nothing “theological” in
this precise formulation, only the insight into the properly dialectical unity of
122                              Quantum History


theory and practice in (not only) psychoanalytic interpretation: the “test” of
the analyst’s interpretation is in the truth-effect it unleashes in the patient.
   This, of course, brings us back to the pre-ontological Real: what the truth-
effect transforms is not external reality but the Real as the abyss that sustains
the dimension of subjectivity. Or, in the terms of quantum mechanics: instead
of changing reality, intervene in the space of quantum waves. Recall the line
from Virgil quoted at the beginning of Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams: “If I
cannot sway the heavens I will move the underground.” Instead of directly
changing reality, the analyst makes his analysand move the Real of his
unconscious underground.

            Heidegger’s politics
                of finitude


Heidegger interprets Kant’s transcendental schematism, perhaps the most
interesting—and simultaneously the most enigmatic—part of Kant’s first
Critique, as a mode of disclosure of Being. A transcendental schema is “the
procedural rule by which a category or pure, non-empirical concept is
associated with a sense impression. A private, subjective intuition is thereby
discursively thought to be a representation of an external object.”1 The reason
a schema is needed is that “whenever two things are totally different from each
other, yet must interact, there must be some common characteristic that they
share in order to somehow relate to one another.”2 In this sense, schemata “are
similar to adapters. Just as adapters are devices for fitting together incompatible
parts, schemata connect empirical concepts with the perceptions from which
they were derived”—a simple example: the category of “substance” has sense
for us only if we “schematize” it as the permanent existence of a certain object
in time; “substance” is what remains the same in the flow of temporal changes.
Schematism is thus grounded in the subject’s finitude, in the duality of
spontaneous notional activity and passive exposure to sensual impressions
which the subject cannot overcome owing to its finitude. Does this mean that
schematism disappears, that it is not needed, with Hegel where the notion
immanently generates all its content, so that there is no external Otherness
affecting the subject? Such an understanding relies on a false notion of Hegel’s
idealism as a direct and complete reign of concepts which are able to “swallow”
(mediate, reflexively appropriate) all external content.

                                                                               123
124                               Quantum History


   To elucidate this, a detour through Lacan may be of some help and for a
precise reason: Lacan’s notion of desire is Kantian. There is no relationship
between desire and its object, desire is about the gap that forever separates it
from its object, it is about the lacking object. So is the best description of
Lacan’s central project not that of a critique of pure desire, where the term
“critique” is to be understood in its precise Kantian sense: maintaining the gap
that forever separates every empirical (“pathological”) object of desire from its
“impossible” object-cause whose place has to remain empty? In contrast to
Kant, for whom our capacity to desire is thoroughly “pathological” (since, as he
repeatedly stresses, there is no a priori link between an empirical object and
the pleasure this object generates in the subject), Lacan claims that there is a
“pure faculty of desire,” since desire does have a non-pathological, a priori
object-cause—this object, of course, is what Lacan calls objet petit a.
   Here enters what we could call Lacan’s sexual schematism—which, of
course, works in a way which is different, almost inverted, with regard to Kant’s
schematism. For Lacan, the universal fact is not some set of symbolic norms
but the fact that there is no sexual relationship, and the scheme is not universal
but unique, an individual fantasy invented to render a sexual relation possible.
Fantasy does not simply realize a desire in a hallucinatory way: rather, its
function is similar to that of Kantian “transcendental schematism”—a fantasy
constitutes our desire, provides its coordinates, i.e., it literally “teaches us how
to desire.” To put it in somewhat simplified terms: fantasy does not mean that
when I desire a strawberry cake and cannot get it in reality, I imagine eating it;
fantasy is what tells me that I desire a strawberry cake in the first place. This role
of fantasy hinges on the fact that “there is no sexual relationship,” no universal
formula or matrix guaranteeing a harmonious sexual relationship with one’s
partner: on account of the lack of this universal formula, every subject has to
invent a fantasy of his own, a “private” formula for the sexual relationship—for
a man, the relationship with a woman is possible only inasmuch as she fits his
formula.
   This brings us to a possible Hegelian reading of schematism: there is no
direct “synthesis” between concept and empirical intuitions, concepts cannot
directly penetrate/mediate empirical content, so there has to be a mediating
moment, in the same sense that the unity of god and man can only be enacted
                            Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                      125


through the figure of Christ who is a kind of “scheme” rendering it possible
for god to get over his meaningless transcendence and provide meaning
to human reality. And, again, the Kantian reading would have insisted on
the duality of god and world, on their radically different nature, which is
why a mediator is needed—not a mediator as a link between two different
worlds which exist independently of it but as the third element of a dialectical
triad, as a medium through which the two opposed poles only exist. To
put it pointedly, there is no god which precedes Christ, it is only through
the mediation of Christ (i.e., through his death!) that god fully actualizes
itself.
   This brings us to finitude. Kant can perceive finitude only as the finitude of
the transcendental subject who is constrained by schematism, by the temporal
limitations of transcendental synthesis; i.e., for him, the only finitude is the
finitude of the subject, he does not consider the option that the very categories
he is dealing with can be “finite,” i.e., that they remain categories of abstract
Understanding, and are not yet the truly infinite categories of speculative
Reason. God conceived as opposed (and external) to finite reality is itself finite,
the only true infinity is that of their mediator itself. The task is thus the Hegelian
one: not to “overcome” the finitude (the horizon of schematism) but to transpose
it into the Thing (Absolute) itself. The mess of partial objects that appears in
Hegel’s quote about the “night of the world” is the real in its pre-schematized
mode, Imagination prior to “synthetic” fantasy/meaningfulness . . . Although
there is a giant gap that separates this non-schematized chaos of the “night of
the world” from Heidegger’s notion of finitude and historicity, does Heidegger
not also provide a radical notion of how every version of universal Destiny
relies on a historical contingency? Dasein is a being

   with no inherent teleology or universal or even available ground (an answer
   to the question of why what fundamentally matters in the world does or
   ought to matter). What originally matters is inextricable from our
   thrownness into a certain historical world, so what comes to matter is a
   question of contingency. . . . So, the only possible constancy to a life (and so
   the only way Dasein as some sort of whole is available to itself) is a
   background resolve, an always underlying readiness for anxiety and an
126                             Quantum History


  unwillingness to accept in such an attunement whenever called on the
  tranquilizing normalcy of the everyday, inauthentic world of Das Man.
                                                                             (121)

But do everyday engagement and care in our life-world not also provide a kind
of “tranquilizing normalcy”? Heidegger often evokes Novalis’s notion of
homelessness (longing for home)—but what if the fact that what appears as
“mattering” to us is radically contingent indicates that homelessness is the
founding gesture of becoming human, with nothing beneath it? For Heidegger,
every disclosure of “mattering” is radically contingent, rooted in a specific
historical situation, which means that there is no space in Heidegger for some
universal “matterings” like human rights, freedom, dignity, etc. Here Heidegger
is a true anti-Habermas: every “home” is the obfuscation of the primordial
homelessness, so there is no big Other of transcendental-pragmatic rules of
communication and interaction on which we could and should rely
independently of our home. Pippin is thus right in characterizing Heidegger’s
approach as “dramatically isolating or individualizing”:

  A background standing attunement to the constant impendingness of one’s
  own death is intensely private and unsharable, and with such a notion at the
  center it makes almost all of ordinary life escapist and even cowardly. There
  seems to be behind it some dark view that the only possible human dignity
  is a refusal of self-deceit in the face of the ungraspability of one’s death.
                                                                             (122)

“Almost all of ordinary life”—so not just das Man but caring relating to ready-
at-hand included. The rather obvious problem is here: how does authentic care
relate to das Man? Is it just simply rootedness in a concrete historical world
versus the abstract rootless universality of today’s “global citizens”? There are
four existential stances at work here: authentic care of being-thrown into a
historical disclosure of Being; anxiety when we confront our mortality; rootless
das Man; traditional metaphysical distanced observation (which quantum
mechanics undermines in the domain of science itself). If care taken radically,
with no reliance on the big Other, in its abyss, we get anxiety. (Although
Heidegger as a rule perceives the anxiety of being-towards-death as an
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                    127


individual experience, he sometimes hints that a society can also make an
authentic collective decision when confronted with the threat of its
annihilation.)
   When, in his interpretation of The Critique of Practical Reason, Heidegger
reads the a priori “feelings” mentioned by Kant (respect, dignity, anxiety,
guilt . . .) not just as empirical psychic states but as modes of transcendental
attunement, he engages in a short but interesting attempt to define the
distinction between pleasure and enjoyment:

   According to Kant there pertains to sensibility in the broader sense not only
   the faculty of sensation but also the faculty he commonly designates as the
   feeling of pleasure and unpleasure, or delight in the agreeable, or the reverse.
   Pleasure in the widest sense is not only desire for something and pleasure in
   something but always also, as we may say, enjoyment; this is a way in which
   the human being, turning with pleasure towards something, experiences
   himself as enjoying—he is joyous.3

Heidegger abandons this exploration too soon: his false opposition between
pleasure and enjoyment is built on the opposition between object and subject
(we find pleasure in an object, we enjoy when we turn towards such an object),
but he leaves out of consideration the link between enjoyment and pain: a
subject can enjoy pain itself, i.e., he can find enjoyment in its very renunciation
to pleasure—enjoyment is beyond the pleasure principle. We are thereby
approaching the old Freudian question: why do we enjoy oppression itself?
That is to say, power asserts its hold over us not simply by oppression
(and repression) which are sustained by a fear of punishment, but by bribing
us for our obedience and enforced renunciations—what we get in exchange
for our obedience and renunciations is a perverted pleasure in renunciation
itself, a gain in loss itself. Lacan called this perverted pleasure surplus-
enjoyment. Surplus-enjoyment implies the paradox of a thing which is always
(and nothing but) an excess with regard to itself: in its “normal” state, it is
nothing. This brings us to Lacan’s notion of objet a as the surplus-enjoyment:
there is no “basic enjoyment” to which one adds the surplus-enjoyment,
enjoyment is always a surplus, in excess. Lacan provides here a kind of Hegelian
response to Foucault: not only do the mechanisms of repression and regulation
128                               Quantum History


generate the excess they endeavour to repress; these mechanisms themselves
get libidinally invested, become a perverse source of surplus-enjoyment of
their own.
   Analyzing Kafka’s “Investigations of a Dog,”4 Aaron Schuster correctly
discerned a radical reversal in the dog ready to starve to death: when his fasting
begins really to hurt, “the truth of nourishment is revealed. What begins as a
struggle not to eat turns into a compulsion to eat the nothing, to feast on the
fast itself.”5 We get here a rather obvious case of the passage from pleasure/
satisfaction to enjoyment: eating which satisfies my hunger provides pleasure,
but extreme hunger, renunciation of eating, gives birth to an enjoyment of its
own, much more radical than the pleasure of eating. In short, the repression of
a desire necessarily turns into a desire for repression, the renunciation of a
pleasure turns into the pleasure in this renunciation, the regulation of pleasures
into a pleasure of regulation. This is what Foucault doesn’t take into account:
how, say, the disciplinary practice of regulating pleasures gets infected itself by
pleasure, as in obsessive or masochist rituals. The true excess is thus not the
excess generated by disciplinary practices, the excess (of pleasure) are these
practices themselves which literally come in excess of what they regulate.
   Back to the main argument: how did we pass/regress from authentically
engaged care to the modern everyday experience of reality as availability for
our manipulation? Pippin proposes that the metaphysical primacy of present-
at-hand over ready-at-hand has somehow penetrated our ordinary experience:
“some screen of theoretical sedimentation in our ordinary expectations has
distorted everything, and what the world is like for us now in its original
availability is not what it is actually like for us.”(129) The idea that the alienation
of our actual daily lives is due to the “theoretical sedimentation in our ordinary
expectations”—in short, that a philosophical stance had fundamentally
influenced the daily behaviour of people—seems to me very problematic—is it
not much more convincing to introduce here the notion of social classes and
of the division of labour? Does the theoretical distance towards reality and its
scientific exploitation and manipulation not presuppose a double division, the
division between those who work and those who live from the work of others,
as well as the division in the production process itself between those who are
constrained to the physical work and those who plan and regulate this work?
                            Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                        129


   In short, we may say that, in describing the technological exploitation of
nature, Heidegger ignores the social relationship within which this happens. To
clarify this point, let’s turn to the classical question of political economy: is
labour the only source of value? The obvious and “logical” reply is: no, there
are three sources, labour, material on which the work is done, and instruments
used in the work. But Marx is basically right here because he sees the value of
a commodity not as the property of an object but as the expression of a social
relationship, and human beings are the only elements in a social relationship.
The same goes for the “radical” ecological stance according to which not only
human beings but also animals and other sentient beings, and for some even
rivers and mountains, have certain basic rights. Only humans have rights since
rights come with responsibilities, and only humans can be held responsible—
we cannot hold a dog who killed a small baby responsible for its act. So
although we should, of course, be extremely cautious not to cause too much
pain to animals, etc., it is deceptive to talk about their rights—if we do, we
come close to the situation in France in the late Middle Ages when, for example,
birds which invaded a church and desecrated it were put to court and
condemned to death.
   This line of thought brings us inescapably to the topic of Evil. For Kant, the
most radical form of Evil is not a conscious choice of knowingly acting against
the Good but the renunciation of the very choice, of the freedom implied by a
choice. You are evil when you renounce your freedom and commit problematic
acts as if you are predetermined to do it, like Russia is saying about Ukraine
and the IDF about Gaza: “We had no choice, we cannot do but . . .” One should
nonetheless remember that a truly great ethical act also does not imply a
simple trivial choice but the logic of “I simply cannot do it otherwise, if I were
not to do it I wouldn’t be able to look at my face in the mirror . . .” This similarity,
of course, conceals a radical difference: when I renounce the choice (and this
very renunciation is choosing Evil even if what I do is quite respectable) I do it
in a comfortable spirit, getting rid of the pressure of responsibility: “That’s how
it is, what can one do?”; when I perform a proper ethical act, I am haunted by
a terrifying pressure, there is nothing relaxing in it—here, I don’t renounce my
freedom, I am fully conscious that I freely chose what was ethically necessary
for me to do.
130                               Quantum History


   This prevalent form of ordinary Evil is most palpable in today’s obsession
with the struggle against cruelty and violence: the scope of acts which can
count as cruel expands more and more—a dirty word, a malevolent gaze, a
small obscene gesture . . . However, this obsession with cruelty is not sustained
by moral fanaticism but by what one cannot but call “human rights realism”:
yes, human rights, but don’t pretend that we don’t all have blood under our
skin, so we have to be realists and not expect too much from others or from
ourselves—in other words, let’s obey the law and be kind to others, but only as
much as it is realistically possible, and let’s violate the law only when it is really
necessary, when there is no other rational way. The implication of this stance is
that we are not really free: freedom is an illusion shared by rare fanatics who as
a rule destroy themselves, while for us, ordinary people, the best is to surrender
to circumstances and drift with the current . . . The paradox here is that the
repressed freedom (the radical freedom we renounce when we decide to live a
“rational” controlled life which avoids excesses) returns with a vengeance in
excessive brutality that more and more permeates our lives: mass outbursts
of “irrational” violence, ritualized gang brutality, pleasure in humiliating
others . . .6
   So what does Heidegger have to offer to this conundrum? How does he deal
with what we perceive as the big Evils of the twentieth century? As expected,
Heidegger’s basic reference is to the ontological difference: the true Evil are not
“ontic” crimes like gas chambers but the ontological nihilism of the global
scientific-technological civilization. However, two things cannot but strike the
reader here. Although Heidegger does here and there risk a dialogue with a
Japanese person or some other non-Western thinker, the space of historicity
proper is for him the West from the so-called pre-Socratics onwards, a sequence
which culminates in today’s global technological civilization. One cannot
avoid here a naïve question: what about other parts of the world, India, China,
Africa—what about their spirituality, their world-disclosures? And, especially,
how could it happen that they are all also conquered by the global scientific-
technological civilization, caught in what we call “progress”? Why and how did
their spirituality get caught in the same path towards nihilism?
   The second thing to note about Heidegger’s insistence on the properly
transcendental-ontological level of the Disclosure/Meaningfulness of Being is
                          Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                   131


that secretly (or not even so secretly) it relies on many ontic choices. For
example (and this is arguably THE example), for Heidegger the nihilism of
modern technological manipulation is not simply a global feature of today’s
world but is repeatedly identified with Judaism. Even in 1948, after the end of
World War II, Heidegger urged an examination of “Jewry’s predisposition to
planetary criminality [planetarischen Verbrechertum]”:

   With their marked gift for calculation, the Jews “live” according to the
   principle of race, and indeed have done so for the longest time, for which
   reason they themselves most vigorously resist its unrestricted application.
   The arrangement of racial breeding stems not from “life” itself, but from
   the hyperempowerment of life by machination [Machenschaft]. What this
   brings about with such planning is a complete deracination of peoples by
   harnessing them in a uniformly constructed and streamlined arrangement
   of all entities. Along with deracination goes a self-alienation of peoples—
   the loss of history—i.e., of the regions of decision for being [Seyn].7

The philosophical background of these lines is the opposition between fully
living in a concrete world, assuming the way being discloses itself to us in an
always unique Event, and the denial of such concrete spiritual-historical roots
in the abstract stance of objectivizing the world into “external reality” as
something to be manipulated and exploited. Defenders of Heidegger claim
that he simply confuses here the metaphysical stance of rootless Machenschaft
that predominates today with an empirical people (Jews) which embodies this
stance at its most radical, so that one can get rid of Heidegger’s anti-Semitism
by being more faithful to Heidegger than Heidegger himself, i.e., by sticking all
the way to the ontologico-ontic difference.
   Is Heidegger not committing here the classic mistake of positing a specific
historical agent which has to be responsible for our woes? In Bryan Singer’s
The Usual Suspects, Verbal Kint says to inspector Kujan who interrogates
him: “The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he
didn’t exist.” This—known line from the film is a paraphrase of a statement by
Charles Baudelaire who wrote a story that appeared in Le Figaro in 1864 in
which he claimed: “la plus belle des ruses du Diable est de vous persuader qu’il
n’existe pas!” [The most beautiful of the cunnings of the Devil is to convince us
132                               Quantum History


that he doesn’t exist.] In the film, Kint says this line to convince Kujan that
Keyser Soze, the mythical all-powerful criminal mastermind, really exists as a
person, i.e., that he is not just a figure of mythic imagination. (One should be
more precise here: Keyser Soze’s disposal of those who know him is not the
same as Mr. Arkadin’s (from Orson Welles’s film of the same name) who wants
to erase all the traces of his problematic past, before he became a big public
person; it is also not to remain fully unknown (like le Carré’s Karla whose
existence itself should be unknown). Keyser Soze wants to be known as
somebody whose features are unknown, he wants to be known as a terrifying
obscure threat.)
   But I think the contrary is true: the greatest trick the Devil (or, rather, the
ideology which operates with the Devil) pulled was to convince us that he
exists, i.e., that “the Devil” is not just a mythic subjectivation (presentation) of
the chaotic horrors of social life, that there is a single person who really pulls
the strings behind social evils—an ideological operation at its purest. The anti-
Semitic version of this trick would have been something like: “The greatest
cunning of the Jews is to convince us that there is no Jewish conspiracy against
our societies.” However, one should note the practical necessity of such a
subjectivation of the agent of evil: it plays a key role in how evil functions.
   Literally hundreds of articles have been written (and podcasts produced)
on the question: is Verbal Kint really Keyser Soze? The main answers are: yes,
he is, otherwise the ending makes no sense; no, one of the other men in the
line-up at the police station that opens the movie scene is; the real Soze is
Kobayashi who acts as Soze’s lawyer and representative; Soze doesn’t exist as a
real person, he is just a mythic point of reference; Soze is not a name, it
functions as a title which passes from one to another individual . . . In quantum
terms, we have here a series of superpositions: the movie contains hints at all
these possibilities, and the ending (Kint = Soze) obviously works as a collapse
into a single reality. However, I think pursuing this question—focusing on
“who is Soze?”—is the final trap of the movie which makes us miss the more
basic result of the final revelation: yes, Kint is Soze, the big question is answered,
but how does Kujan realize this? After Kint is released and leaves the office,
Kujan looks around the office where he interrogated Kint and realizes that Kint
was composing his narrative by way of incorporating into it fragments of the
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                    133


reality around him in the office (“Kobayashi” is the brand name of the cup of
coffee the two used during the interrogation, etc.). Which means: yes, Kint is
Soze, but this is the only thing we know now—all the stories we’ve heard can
be lies improvised by Kint/Soze . . . So the identity of Kint and Soze is a truth
which turns all we think we know into a potential lie, a truth which entails
almost a kind of Cartesian doubt: everything we know may be a lie. In Lacanian
terms, it is the exception which sustains the universality of a lie. At the end we
thus do not get all the truth (a complete explanation of “what really happened”),
as is the case in usual whodunits: the final truth destroys our continuous effort
to distinguish truth from lies, it turns everything into a potential lie.8 And this
is perhaps one of the most accurate definitions of the Devil.
   To return to Heidegger’s theory, in which he writes that Jews are not the
only place of such a short-circuit between the ontological and the ontic:
the counterpoint to Jews are Germans as the only proper metaphysical people,
the only people who can enact a new epochal beginning. If Germans and Jews
are the two absolute opposites the tension of which can only be resolved
through the annihilation of one pole, does this mean that the Holocaust was in
some sense justified? Here Heidegger takes into account the difference between
the metaphysical stance of Jewishness and the ontic Jews, but in an extremely
perverted way: he interprets the Holocaust (the annihilation of ontic Jews) as
the self-annihilation of the Jews themselves:

   Only when what is essentially “Jewish” in the metaphysical sense battles
   against the Jewish is the pinnacle of self-annihilation in history attained;
   assuming that what is “Jewish” has everywhere seized dominion entirely for
   itself, such that even the battle “of the Jewish,” and this above all, becomes
   subjection to it.9

By accounting for the Holocaust in the terms of the havocs of modern
technologies, Heidegger ignores the pathologies of the German historical
development which culminated in the annihilation of the Jews; in this false
move from the particular to the universal, Germans, the actual perpetrators of
the Holocaust, disappear from the picture, they become just an anonymous
instrument of the self-annihilation of the Jews themselves. And is Israel not
doing something similar when it claims that Palestinians themselves are
134                              Quantum History


responsible for the thousands of dead civilians in Gaza? IDF is targeting only
Hamas members, and since Hamas is using civilians as a human shield, it is
responsible for the suffering and death of those civilians.
   The irony here goes even deeper: Germans (or, more accurately, the Nazis)
become the stand-in of “what is essentially ‘Jewish’ in the metaphysical sense”
in its battle against the empirical Jews. In short, they stand for the much more
radical practice of technological machination, more so than the actual Jews
themselves, so that, to go to the end, Germans themselves were the true agents
of self-annihilation—the destruction of Germany in 1945 was its self-
destruction, something Germany brought upon itself. What Heidegger misses
here is that, in our global capitalism, every reference to roots, to “blood and
soil,” loses its innocence since it already serves the aim of global machination.10
Pippin is right to point out the political implications of Heidegger’s view:

   Heidegger has to claim that what for the Hegelian, or in the Hegelian
   tradition, must count as the pathologies of modernity—alienation,
   reification, domination instead of mutuality of recognitive status, the
   humiliating conditions of the modern organization of labor, anomie,
   deracination—are all best understood as implications of the still “unthought”
   question, the meaning of Being, as descendants of the “metaphysical”
   tradition. As I have suggested, this claim is worth taking more seriously
   than it has been, but the way Heidegger formulates the issue seems to
   exclude all other options as derivative from and so complicit with that
   tradition.
                                                                             (219)

The key word here is “exclude”: it is not that economic exploitation and the
alienating organization of labour can be integrated into Heidegger’s thought as
secondary effects of modern nihilism; any focus on them is to be excluded,
dismissed as not only irrelevant but a dangerous trap. In 1953 Heidegger said
that the end result of World War II “decided nothing”11—nothing in terms
of the history of Being. Russia and America who are “metaphysically the
same” won over Germany not just militarily but also “metaphysically,” by
infecting Germany with the (self)destructive stance of nihilism, depriving
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                   135


Nazism of its “inner greatness.” This is what Heidegger is aiming at in the
following passage from his Black Notebooks:

   If one thought it through from the perspective of destiny, would not, for
   instance, the failure to grasp this destiny—which would not belong to us, if
   the world-willing [Weltwollen] was suppressed [Niederhalten im Weltwollen]
   —would this failure not be much more essentially a “guilt” and “collective
   guilt,” the magnitude of which essentially could not even be measured against
   the gruesomeness of the “gas chambers” [Greuelhaften der “Gaskammern”];
   a guilt—uncannier than all “crimes” that can be “inveighed against”
   publically—which surely no one would forgive in the future. Already today
   “one” does not want to see—this not-willing is far more willing than our
   spinelessness [Willenlosigkeit] in foreboding that Germany and the German
   people are but one concentration camp—the likes of which “the world”
   has not “seen” indeed, and which “the world” does not want to see—this
   not-willing is far more willing than our spinelessness [Willenlosigkeit] in the
   face of the brutalization [Verwilderung] of National Socialism.12

Let’s note here first the problematic nature of guilt; as the dying Sian tells
Darby at the end of episode 5 of A Murder at the End of the World: “Guilt is so
easy, easier to blame yourself than contend with the truth.” This reversal of the
standard wisdom (blaming others to avoid one’s own guilt) is the basic claim
of psychoanalysis, and it applies precisely to Oedipus. At the end of the
Sophocles’ play, Oedipus doesn’t admit his guilt: he knows he killed his father
and married his mother, but he didn’t know anything about this (no place here
for some unconscious desires!).
   Back to the long quote from Heidegger—if we read this paragraph carefully,
the message is clear: the gas chambers are an ontic crime and as such
incomparably less terrifying than the German defeat in 1945 which made all of
Germany and the German people one big concentration camp, a spineless
people deprived of its world-willing, a willingness to engage in a historical
disclosure of authentic Being. In short, the guilt of this ontological betrayal is
incomparably more important than the guilt for the holocaust—or, as Peter
Trawny put it concisely:
136                              Quantum History


   If “we” [Germans] were “suppressed” in pursuing this “world-willing”—
   now, after the war—this “suppression” would be “guilt,” the magnitude of
   which could not even be measured against the gruesomeness of the gas
   chambers. The “world-willing” of the “Germans” is ontohistorically more
   important than the “gruesomeness of the gas chambers.”13

The expression “brutalization [Verwilderung] of National Socialism” thus
indicates that it was the global stance of calculation and technological
domination which “brutalized” National Socialism, at its origins a much more
positive spiritual project. The universalization of an actual terrifying event into
an all-encompassing metaphor is crucial here: the Nazi concentration camps
were a (gruesome, true) real event, but after World War II, the whole of occupied
Germany became one big concentration camp . . . The same universalization
often occurred when white liberals expressed their horror at the practice of
female castration in some Third World countries (especially in Africa): the
reply was that white liberals have no right to complain about this because plastic
surgeries that are taking place among millions of white women are nothing but
a kind of extension of clitoridectomy to the entire body of a woman . . .
                                   *
I remember from my youth, the time of the student revolts in late 1960s, how
some Europeans, Heideggerians sympathetic to student protests, interpreted
them in generalized ontological terms as the rejection of the technological-
consumerist society and a craving for a new beginning—or, as the Croat
Heideggerian Vanja Sutlić said: “Che Guevara in Bolivia is not just fighting
capitalism, he wants a new world outside metaphysical nihilism.” (Incidentally,
when, in 1967, a group of protesting students from Berlin visited Heidegger, he
expressed his support for them, claiming that they were trying to achieve
what he strived for in 1934 as the rector of the Freiburg university.14) Although
Pippin is sensitive to Heidegger’s simplifications and unanswered questions—
see the final paragraphs of his book—he doesn’t go all the way here, especially
with regard to politics: Heidegger is indifferent towards “ontic” justice, moral
responsibility, guilt of the Holocaust, even empirical threats to the environment
and acting against them. The question raised by Pippin here is simply irrelevant
from Heidegger’s standpoint:
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                      137


   Heidegger has framed all such issues as dependent on, and reflecting some
   sense, of the historical meaningfulness of Being and that means the context
   of his question about the reconciling powers of reason is a question about
   mattering. How could Hegel approach a question like whether a mutual
   recognitive status in modern ethical life matters, and if so how much, and if
   a lot, why?
                                                                              (220)

It is not difficult to guess Heidegger’s reply: the very ideal of mutual recognition
and dignity remains within the frame of modern subjectivity and is as such
ultimately the source of what is wrong in modernity, demonstrating that the
failure of modernity is its truth. Or, to put it brutally in the terms of “mattering”
(a disclosure of Being determines the basic frame of what matters to the
subjects who find themselves thrown into a specific historical world): for
Heidegger, human rights and mutual recognition ultimately don’t matter. The
only thing that really matters is the willingness of a people to freely assume its
destiny, an act of total commitment which has nothing to do with free dialogue
and negotiation.
   But the question remains: if what Heidegger describes as the primordial
opening/disclosure/attunement is not cut/traversed by class difference, is the
attunement that discloses the world as an object of technological manipulation
really simply shared by all people in a modern epoch? When Pippin recapitulates
Heidegger’s notion of modern society as one of productive exploitation,
manipulation and consummation of all reality, he adds in parenthesis: “(Although
he would never put it this way, it would not be unfair to invoke another word to
capture this situation: capitalism.)”(214) This begs the response: yes, but why
would Heidegger never name capitalism? Why is the word prohibited in his
language? In all probability, Heidegger’s answer would have been that capitalism
is just one among ontic organizations of the technological disclosure of Being—
as he put it, Soviet Union and the US are “metaphysically the same.” To this we
should insist that capitalism is not simply an ontic phenomenon, one of the
possible versions of technological attunement: capitalism is not just a social
phenomenon, it also has a transcendental-ontological status. It is not modern
science and technology as such which push us to continuous domination over
138                              Quantum History


and exploitation of nature—they function like this only within the frame of
capitalism with its permanent propensity towards expanded self-reproduction.
   So Pippin is right here: it is not enough to mention technological availability
as the source of the disappearance of Meaningfulness—one should add the
word “capitalism” never used by Heidegger. Here Marx surprisingly meets
radical conservatives: Patrick Buisson, the French ultra-conservative, was
right in claiming that “le grand deconstructeur, c’est le capitalisme.”15 Plus
we should add that the disclosure of beings as objects of technological
manipulation and exploitation is not homogeneous: the objects of such
exploitation immanently resist it, which brings us back to class struggle, a
notion even more unmentionable for Heidegger than capitalism.
   Is Heidegger’s Nazi engagement just a stupid error or is it grounded in his basic
philosophical stance? Or, even worse, what if his very basic philosophical stance is
grounded in his Nazi engagement? The only way to clarify this topic is to turn the
question around and analyze the implicit philosophical foundations of Hitler’s
work itself. (This, of course, doesn’t mean that we should elevate Hitler into a
serious philosopher—the task is just to explore the implicit ontological foundations
of Hitler’s “thought.”) Peter Trawny’s Hitler, Philosophy and Hatred: Notes on the
discourse on identity politics16 risks this daring step which is deeply justified,
although it will appear problematic to many, especially in today’s electrified
atmosphere; the book’s approach is best rendered by the publisher’s summary:

   To believe that European discourse can keep National Socialism at a
   distance, like an object, is at best a naïve hypothesis, but at worst a political
   mistake. One then pretends that National Socialism had no contact with the
   rest of Europe, with other philosophers, with other political and religious
   languages. This is why Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf is still considered a
   book unworthy of philosophical discussion. This attitude sheds light on
   philosophy itself. Does it possibly find too much of itself in Mein Kampf?
   And what is it exactly that it finds there? Trawny’s reading of Hitler’s book
   does not avoid the possibility of a continuity between philosophy and
   National Socialism. It is an encounter with a hatred that threatens us simply
   because it once seized power and dominated the life of a society. There is no
   reason to think that the hatred has passed away.17
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                    139


With regard to Heidegger, the result that imposes itself from such a reading—
for those who, in spite of all counter-arguments, continue to hold Heidegger
up as a great philosophical figure—is more than just paradoxical, it is very
painful. Yes, there are two facts that we should accept: Heidegger was an
engaged Nazi AND he was a titan of philosophy, he formulated some crucial
philosophical insights. But what if Heidegger saw certain crucial things not in
spite of but precisely because of his problematic political stance? This absolutely
doesn’t imply that there is a deeper truth in Nazism; it means that to see
something at the level of ontology, one has to “err” at the ontic level—not just
err in the sense of mistakes but err in the sense of terrifying monstrosity. A
Jewish friend of mine who is close to Heidegger and simultaneously deeply
immersed in Jewish spirituality,18 claimed that some Talmudic texts indicate
how some painful truths can only be said from the position of Satan. This, of
course, should not remain our final position: one should pass through
Heidegger and supplement his thought so that it no longer requires the Nazi
link (to simplify it, so that the three authentic spiritual positions are no longer
those of a poet, a warrior, and a farmer).
   Do we, in the “liberal” West, have an alternative to oppose to the dark
prospect raised by Trawny? Any reference to the “complexity” of the situation
is a fake here—the answer is a simple NO. The parallel between today’s
pro-Palestinian student protests and the 1968 anti-Vietnam-war protests are
often noted; however, Franco Berardi also noted an important difference
between the two. Rhetorically, at least, the 1968 protesters identified with anti-
imperialist defense of Vietcong and with a socialist project, but today’s
protesters very rarely identify with Hamas. What, then, do they identify with?
Berardi’s bitter hypothesis is that

   students are identifying with despair. Despair is the psychological and also
   cultural trait that explains the wide identification of young people with the
   Palestinians. I think that the majority of the students today are consciously
   or unconsciously expecting the irreversible worsening of the conditions of
   life, irreversible climate change, a long lasting period of war, and the looming
   danger of a nuclear precipitation of the conflicts that are underway in many
   points of the geopolitical map.19
140                               Quantum History


It is difficult to put it better than Berardi. The first step towards hope is to fully
admit our desperate predicament in all its dimensions. What Adorno wrote
decades ago—“Nothing but despair can save us.”20—is today more true than
ever. Adorno’s line echoes Kafka’s basic idea that the only success, the only
solution, is the failure of failure itself. Does this amount to a version of Beckett’s
famous formula from his 1983 story “Worstward Ho”: “Ever tried. Ever failed.
No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”?
   One can read Lacan’s entire theoretical development in this sense: all his
attempts to find the right word (or formula) for his theoretical edifice failed,
and he then moves to another attempt to “fail better”—from four discourses to
mathems, from mathems to knots . . .—and in his very brief last seminar
session he openly admits that all these attempts failed. But with Kafka the
“failure of the failure” does involve a kind of negation of negation which ends
the infinite line of failures, although not the usual pseudo-Hegelian one of
negating the failure and succeeding. The failure of failure means that when we
fail we should not just approach the same goal in a different more realistic or
more efficient way: what we should renounce is the very standard-ideal-goal
we tried to achieve. The unsurpassable model of the Kafkaesque failure of a
failure is, of course, the situation described in the last lines of his “parable” on
the door of the Law from The Trial: the man from the country fails to enter the
door of the Law, and this failure fails when he is told that door was there just
for him:

   The gatekeeper has to bend way down to him, for the great difference has
   changed things to the disadvantage of the man. “What do you still want to
   know, then?” asks the gatekeeper. “You are insatiable.” “Everyone strives
   after the law,” says the man, “so how is that in these many years no one
   except me has requested entry?” The gatekeeper sees that the man is already
   dying and, in order to reach his diminishing sense of hearing, he shouts at
   him, “Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only
   to you. I’m going now to close it.”21

Do we not get something similar on the southern side of the demilitarized
zone that divides North from South Korea? South Koreans built there a unique
place to visit: a theater with a large screen-like window in front, opening up
                           Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                    141


onto the North. The spectacle the public observes when they take seats and
look through the window is reality itself (or, rather, a kind of “desert of the
real”): the barren demilitarized zone with walls, etc., and, beyond, a glimpse of
North Korea. However, as if to comply with the fiction, North Korea has built
in front of this theater a pure fake, a model village with beautiful houses; in the
evening, the lights in all the houses are turned on at the same time, people are
given good dresses and are obliged to take a stroll every evening . . . One can
easily imagine a Kafkaesque conclusion of this show: all of a sudden, the lights
in the model village are turned off and a voice from the North says: “This
spectacle was assigned only to you. North Korea is now going to close it.”
   Nothing new, one could add: the spectators from the South knew this all the
time—but the enigma remains: if they knew it all the time (i.e., if they knew
that North Korea built that model village just for them to see it), why are they
so fascinated by it that they enjoy looking at it? This brings us to a further
difference between Kafka and North Korea: Kafka’s man from the country
desperately wants to pass through the door of the Law (probably to resolve
some legal problem he is caught in), while the observers from the South don’t
want to effectively visit the model village in the North—they know very well
they are just watching a spectacle staged for them. It is more like a cinema
performance where what we see on the screen is reality itself staged for us. The
true enigma resides elsewhere, in the Other’s desire: why is North Korea, with
its ideology of self-sufficiency (juche), so keen to impress a foreign gaze, i.e.,
the gaze of its mortal enemies? Why doesn’t it simply decide to ignore the
foreign view? What if North Korea is—in its very impenetrability—already
caught into a libidinal economy which includes us?
   Another unexpected link emerges here: what about Kafka and quantum
mechanics? Is the doorkeeper’s final message (“the door is here only for you”)
not similar to the basic claim of quantum mechanics about how an observer is
always included into (what we experience as) objective reality which exists
independently of our observation? Theorists like Carlo Rovelli pointed out
convincingly that this claim (the inclusion of the observer) does not imply
some sort of subjective idealism (“my mind creates reality”)—on the contrary,
it implies a materialist axiom that we (observers) are also part of the world,
that we do not observe it from some privileged external position . . . Yet another
142                              Quantum History


unexpected link: with the ongoing war in Gaza, do we not get from both
sides—Hamas and IDF—horrors which are (partially, at least) also committed
for the observers (witnesses, cameras, digital media)? The devastation of Gaza
was also made to impress on the observers the strength of the IDF and Israel’s
capacity to destroy those whom they perceive as threats to its existence.
   With the explosive development of Artificial Intelligence, we are approaching
the obverse of the situation described by Kafka: in my interaction with a digital
agent, I act as if I am a partner in an actual dialogue (AI can easily program a
partner who looks and acts like a human), but the AI system opposite is just a
blind mechanism ignoring my subjectivity—the doors are not just for me, they
are for anyone . . . The circle so nicely described by Schuster—the obscure and
all-powerful agency which appears to dominate the Kafkaesque subject (the
Court, the Castle . . .) is in reality his symptom, his unconscious formation
onto which he projects his repressed traumas and antagonisms, so that his
destruction is a self-destruction—can no longer be applied here: the AI mega-
machine does not function as an obstacle which is simultaneously a positive
condition to the emergence of a subject.
   It is even very problematic to turn this relationship around and say that
humans become symptoms of the AI machines, the embodiments of the
machines’ inner inconsistencies and impossibilities—this holds more for our
common language which subjectivizes itself through the subject that gives
body to the lack of a “true Word” . . . Will then an all-powerful AI apparatus
induce in a subject caught in it a real psychosis, not just a paranoia? Will the
big Other become a real object, not just a virtual/non-existent agent? However,
it may happen that if AI develops not human consciousness but a radically
new form of self-awareness, its absolute strangeness will give rise to neurosis,
to a questioning of “what does AI want” . . .22
   But, again, how does all this affect the notion of a revolution? One thing is
certain: we should leave behind the standard paradigm/excuse of “next time
we’ll do it in a better, totally different way.” We, the agents, should begin from
the zero-point, and this zero-point does not mean a radical destruction/
reconstruction of social reality but a radical destruction/reconstruction of
ourselves, of our innermost subjectivity. This is what Kafka meant when he
wrote in a letter to Max Brod: “There is infinite hope—just not for us.”23 An
                             Heidegger’s Politics of Finitude                  143


ambiguous statement which can also mean: not for us as we are now, so we
have to change radically, to be reborn. But what has this to do with revolution?
After his statement that subject is a cause of itself, Lacan goes on: “Entering
onto this path is where the only true political revolution may flow from.”24
Kafka noticed apropos the October Revolution:

   The decisive moment in human development is everlasting. For this reason
   the revolutionary movements of intellect/spirit that declare everything
   before them to be null and void are in the right, for nothing has yet
   happened.25

Here is Schuster’s commentary on these lines:

   It’s not that history has ended, as so many Hegel-inspired critics have
   repeated in various contexts. Rather, the end has already occurred, and the
   real question is whether, and when, history will begin. Kafka’s universe is
   marked by an unbearable tension between extreme closure and boundless
   openness, between the end that has already taken place and the beginning
   that is yet to start.26

This brings us to the well-known Gramsci remark from his Prison Notebooks:
“The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot
be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms [ fenomeni
morbosi] appear.”27 From today’s Kafkaesque experience, this remark appears
all too naïve: our present is ALWAYS the one in which the old is dying
and the new cannot be born. In social change, capitalism is disintegrating but
the new socialist order cannot be born and we get morbid symptoms (like
techno-feudalism); in sexual economy the old patriarchy is disintegrating and
the new free sexuality cannot be born, so we are getting morbid symptoms, etc.
The worst (Stalinist or Fascist) illusion is that a direct smooth passage from the
Old to the New is possible and that we just missed it due to our contingent
limitations (for example, the idea that Stalinism arose because the first
revolution happens in the wrong place, in “backwards” Russia and not in the
developed West).
   The temporality of such passages is crucial. Joseph Brodsky surmised that,
after 15–20 years in power, a tyrant invariably “decides to immortalize himself
144                              Quantum History


by doing something horrendous”: “The average length of a good tyranny is a
decade and a half, two decades at most. When it’s more than that, it invariably
slips into a monstrosity.”28 His judgment seems to be right: it was 19 years after
the October Revolution that the Stalinist Great Purges exploded, and it was
17 years after the victory of the Chinese Revolution that the Great Cultural
Revolution was set in motion.
                                       *
In view of the recent worldwide rise of fascisms as the reaction to the crisis of
global capitalism, Todd McGowan29 suggested that we should reverse the well-
known Walter Benjamin line: “It’s not that every fascism is the result of a failed
revolution but that fascism is the natural response that capitalism engenders.”
The new logical order is thus: capitalism reacts to a crisis with some form of
fascism, and the emancipatory resistance is then a reaction to this fascist threat.
So we have here non-commutativity, but in an inverted order: there is no
radical emancipation without a fascist threat.
                                         *
So what if, in fidelity to Kafka’s vision, we turn things on their head: the true
“morbid symptom” is our image of the proper New that we expected to emerge,
and the solution is precisely and only to be sought in new “morbid” solutions
that we improvise to avoid the catastrophe at the horizon. The only thing to
add here is that “unbearable tension between extreme closure and boundless
openness” is already present in Hegel’s thought where extreme closure (the
closed circle of the Hegelian system where the end coincides with the
beginning) coincides with radical openness: the system cannot say anything
about the future, there is no deeper “historical necessity” indicating the way.

        The hologram of
    conflicting universalities


Lately the notion of universality enjoys a bad reputation—the predominant
commonplace is that a position which presents itself as neutral-universal
effectively privileges a certain (heterosexual, male, Christian . . .) culture:
“universal human rights are effectively the rights of the white male private
owners to exchange freely on the market, exploit workers and women, as well
as exert political domination . . .” This, however, is only half of the story: not
only do we live today in a world which is less universal than we think (since we
are all caught in particular cultural universes)—we are simultaneously more
universal than we think since we are all enmeshed in trans-cultural global
capitalism.
   What begs to be questioned is the emergence of the very form of universality:
how, in what specific historical conditions, does abstract Universality itself
become a “fact of (social) life”? In what conditions do individuals experience
themselves as subjects of universal human rights? Therein resides the point of
Marx’s analysis of “commodity fetishism”: in a society in which commodity
exchange predominates, individuals themselves, in their daily lives, relate to
themselves, as well as to the objects they encounter, as contingent embodiments
of abstract-universal notions. What I am, my concrete social or cultural
background, is experienced as contingent, since what ultimately defines me is
the “abstract” universal capacity to think and/or to work. The modern notion
of “profession” implies that I experience myself as an individual who is not
directly “born into” his social role—what I will become depends on the

                                                                              147
148                               Quantum History


interplay between contingent social circumstances and my free choice; in this
sense, contemporary individuals have a profession—that of electrician or
professor or waiter—while it is meaningless to claim that a medieval serf was
a peasant by profession. In certain specific social conditions (of commodity
exchange and a global market economy), “abstraction” becomes a direct feature
of actual social life, the way concrete individuals behave and relate to their fate
and to their social surroundings. Universality becomes “for itself ” only insofar
as individuals no longer fully identify the kernel of their being with their
particular social situation, only insofar as they experience themselves as
forever “out of joint” with regard to this situation: the mode of appearance of
an abstract Universality, its entering into actual existence, is thus an extremely
violent move of disrupting the preceding texture of social life.
   Universality-for-itself is thus to be opposed to any notion of organic totality,
of a Whole in which every particular element has its allotted place: in a totality,
its universality becomes for itself in one of its elements which cannot achieve
full identity in it, which lacks a proper place in it, i.e., whose particular identity
is thwarted, which cannot actualize itself in its particularity. For radical
feminism, women (not men) stand for universality insofar as they are prevented
from fully becoming what they are (with regard to their immanent potentials).
And the same tension seems to haunt formulations of Jewish identity. In his
Black Notebooks, Heidegger characterized Jews as a failed nation, a rootless
people with no land, fatally prone to calculation and manipulation—however,
what Heidegger ignored is that the very fact that Jews had “failed” as a nation
was what made them great, a stand-in for universality.
      The “logic” of this type of traditional anti-Semitism was complicated once
Zionists themselves began to evoke the cliché of roots, or, as Alain Finkielkraut
wrote in 2015 in a letter to le Monde: “The Jews, they have today chosen the
path of rootedness.”1 It is easy to discern in this claim an echo of Heidegger
who, in his Spiegel interview, posits that all essential and great things can only
emerge from our having a homeland, from being rooted in a specific historical
tradition. The irony is that in today’s Zionism we are dealing with a weird
attempt to mobilize anti-Semitic clichés in order to legitimize Zionism: anti-
Semitism reproaches the Jews for being rootless, and it is as if Zionism tries to
correct this failure by belatedly providing Jews with roots . . . No wonder many
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                149


conservative anti-Semites ferociously support the expansion of the State of
Israel. The problem is that now the radical Zionist Jews act as if they can have
their cake and eat it: they have a land and state, but they still maintain the claim
to universality.
   This tension unfortunately makes Israel a failed state. The sad state of affairs
in Haiti in 2024 provides an extreme and tragic case of a so-called failed state:
illegal criminal gangs took over the public space and control 80% of the country.
But are the West Bank settlers who threaten Palestinians there, physically
attacking them, stealing their land and ruining their crops, in full view of the
Israeli army and police forces, not also a gang openly violating the law? What
does it imply then when their actions are not only tolerated but even supported
by the (Israeli) forces of law and order? Consider that the Israeli minister of
security, responsible for commanding the police, is Itamar Ben Gvir, who was
convicted by an Israeli court for anti-Palestinian terrorism . . . The sad lesson is
that today the supposedly sacred values of Western democracies are less and
less in evidence even in the developed West itself: if we measure a failed state by
the cracks in the edifice of state power, as well as the heightened atmosphere of
ideological civil war and the growing insecurity of public spaces, then Israel
and even the United States are on a fast-track to become one.
   Such a confused situation elicits a desperate search for some ideological
form that would maintain social stability, and the first obvious candidate is, of
course, religion. Marx’s well-known characterization of religion as the “opium
of the people” nonetheless remains all too naïve. It is true that radical Islam is
an exemplary case of religion as the opium of the people: a false confrontation
with capitalist modernity which allows the Muslims to dwell in their ideological
dream while their countries are ravaged by the effects of global capitalism—
and exactly the same holds for Christian fundamentalism. However, there are
today, in our Western world, two other versions of the opium of the people:
they are, literally, the opium and the people.
   Invoking “the people” functions today as a fuzzy populist dream destined to
obfuscate our own antagonisms. And for many among us the opium of the
people is opium itself, escape into drugs. Chemistry (in its scientific version) is
becoming part of us: large aspects of our lives are characterized by the
management of our emotions by drugs, from everyday use of sleeping pills and
150                              Quantum History


anti-depressants to hard narcotics. We are not just controlled by impenetrable
social powers, our very emotions are “outsourced” to chemical stimulation. The
stakes of this chemical intervention are double and contradictory: we use
drugs to keep external excitement (shocks, anxieties, etc.) under control, i.e., to
de-sensitize us to them, and to generate artificial excitement if we are depressed
and lack desire. Drugs thus react to the two opposed threats to our daily lives,
over-excitement and depression, and it is crucial to notice how these two uses
of drugs relate to the distinct spheres of private and public: in the developed
Western countries, our public lives more and more lack collective excitement
(such as would be provided by a genuine political engagement), while drugs
supplant this lack with private (or, rather, intimate) forms of excitement—
drugs perform the euthanasia of public life and the artificial excitation of
private life. The country whose daily life is most impregnated by this tension is
South Korea, and here is Franco Berardi’s report on his journey to Seoul:

   Korea is the ground zero of the world, a blueprint for the future of the
   planet. . . . In the emptied cultural space, the Korean experience is marked
   by an extreme degree of individualization and simultaneously it is headed
   towards the ultimate cabling of the collective mind. These lonely monad
   walks in the urban space in tender continuous interaction with the pictures,
   tweets, games coming out of their small screens, perfectly insulated and
   perfectly wired into the smooth interface of the flow. . . . South Korea has
   the highest suicide rate in the world. Suicide is the most common cause of
   death for those under 40 in South Korea.2

What Berardi’s impressions on Seoul provide is the image of a place deprived
of history, a worldless place (the term was introduced by Alain Badiou). Even
Nazi anti-Semitism, however ghastly it was, opened up a world: it described its
critical situation by positing an enemy which was a “Jewish conspiracy”; it
named a goal and the means of achieving it. Nazism disclosed reality in a way
which allowed its subjects to acquire a global “cognitive mapping,” and opened
up a space for their meaningful engagement.
   Perhaps it is here that one should locate one of the main dangers of
capitalism: although it is global and encompasses the whole world, it deprives
the large majority of people of any meaningful cognitive mapping. Capitalism
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                151


is the first socio-economic order which de-totalizes meaning: it is not global at
the level of meaning. There is, after all, no global “capitalist world view,” no
“capitalist civilization” proper: the fundamental lesson of globalization is
precisely that capitalism can accommodate itself to all civilizations, from
Christian to Hindu or Buddhist, from West to East. Capitalism’s global
dimension can only be formulated at the level of truth-without-meaning, as
the Real of the global market mechanism. No wonder millions are exposed to
the unbearable superego pressure in its two aspects: the pressure to succeed
professionally and the pressure to enjoy life fully in all its intensity.
   This brings us to Alexandre Kojeve, the great interpreter of Hegel from the
1930s to 1950s who saw the moment of the “end of history,” the highest form
of social order, first in Stalinist Russia and then in contemporary Japan. If
Kojeve were to be alive today, he would have located the end of history in
South Korea3—why? South Korea is arguably THE country of free choice—not
in the political sense, but in the sense of daily life, especially among the younger
depoliticized generation. The choice we are talking about is the indifferent
choice of moderate daily pleasures, selecting among options which don’t really
matter: what one listens to and reads, how one dresses, how one socializes and
eats, to which foreign country one goes for a holiday . . . There is a recent movie
that perfectly depicts the stance of such a post-political disengaged individual:
Perfect Days (Wim Wenders 2023, a Japanese-German coproduction) in which
Kōji Yakusho plays Hirayama who works as a toilet cleaner in Tokyo, fully
content with his simple life. Following a ritualized daily rhythm, he repeats it
daily from dawn, and dedicates his free time to his passion for music, in his van
to and from work, and books, every night before bed. Japan comes closest to
South Korea in this trend towards depoliticized disengagement—even the
immensely popular Japanese eco-Marxist Kohei Saito advocates the motto
“slow down” (the title of his last book).
   This new generation mostly doesn’t care about big issues like human rights
and freedoms or the threat of war—while the world still notices the aggressive
pronouncements of the North Korean regime accompanied by nuclear threats,
the large majority in South Korea just ignores them. Since the standard of living
of the large majority is relatively high, one comfortably lives in a bubble. North
Korea is the opposite: permanent mobilization and state of emergency, no free
152                               Quantum History


choices, life focused on how to confront the Enemy . . . To counter this indifference
of the youth which is spreading also in China, Xi Jinping recently lauded Chinese
civilization for its long and continuous history that stretches back to antiquity,
saying that it has shaped the great Chinese nation; he emphasized that it is
imperative to comprehensively improve the protection and utilization of cultural
relics and better preserve and carry forward cultural heritage.4
   It also appears that, hidden from the public, a big struggle is going on within
the Chinese Communist Party between those who advocate the interests of
big corporations and financial capital, and those who want more active
participation of the poor and exploited. My question here is: but what about
the interests of the Party nomenklatura itself? If some of its top echelons want
to limit the power of the big capital, does this automatically make them the
advocate of the working class? If there is a lesson to be learned from twentieth-
century Communism, it is that one should concede that the ruling Party
automatically advocates the interests of the poor and the exploited.
   This is why it’s worth taking a close look at the writings of Wang Huning, a
current member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo Standing
Committee and the director of the Central Guidance Commission on Building
Spiritual Civilization. Wang is correct in emphasizing the key role of culture, of
the domain of symbolic fictions. The true materialist way to oppose the topic
of the “fiction of reality” (subjectivist doubts in the style of “is what we perceive
as reality not just another fiction?”) is not to strictly distinguish between
fiction and reality but to focus on the reality of fictions. Fictions are not outside
reality, they are materialized in our social interactions, in our institutions and
customs—as we can see in today’s mess, if we destroy fictions on which our
social interactions are based, our social reality itself begins to fall apart.
   Wang designated himself as a neo-conservative—what does this mean?
Wang sees his task as imposing a new common ethical substance, and we should
not dismiss this as an excuse to impose the full control of the Communist Party
over social life. Wang is replying to a real problem. Thirty years ago, he wrote a
book America against America where he perceptively noted the antagonisms of
the American way of life, including its darker sides: social disintegration, lack of
solidarity and shared values, nihilist consumerism and individualism . . .5
Trump’s populism is a false way out: it is the climax of social disintegration
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                 153


because it introduces obscenity into public speech and thus deprives it of its
dignity—something not only prohibited but totally unimaginable in China. We
will definitely never see a high-level Chinese politician doing what Trump did
publicly: talk about how large his penis is, imitating a woman’s orgasmic sounds
. . . Wang’s fear was that the same disease may spread to China—which is now
happening at the popular level of mass culture, and the ongoing reforms are a
desperate attempt to put a stop to this trend. Again, will it work?
   It is easy to perceive in the ongoing Chinese campaign a tension between
content and form: the content—the establishment of stable values that hold a
society together—is enforced in the form of mobilization which is experienced
as a kind of state of emergency imposed by the state apparatus. Although the
goal is the opposite of the Cultural Revolution, there are similarities in the way
the campaign is done. The danger is that such tensions can produce cynical
disbelief in the population. More generally, the ongoing campaign in China
seems all too close to standard conservative attempts to enjoy the benefits of
the capitalist dynamism but to control its destructive aspects through a strong
Nation State pushing forward patriotic values.

The ethnic-religious conflicts are the form of struggle which fits global
capitalism: in our age of “post-politics” when politics proper is progressively
replaced by expert social administration, the only remaining legitimate source
of conflicts are cultural (ethnic, religious) tensions. Today’s rise of “irrational”
violence is thus to be conceived as strictly correlative to the depoliticization of
our societies, i.e., to the disappearance of the proper political dimension, its
translation into different levels of “administration” of social affairs. If we accept
this thesis on the “clash of civilizations,” the only alternative to it remains the
peaceful coexistence of civilizations (or of “ways of life,” a more popular term
today): forced marriages and homophobia (or the idea that a woman going
alone to a public place is somehow “fair game” for rapists) are OK, just as long
as they are limited to another country which is otherwise fully included into
the world market.
                                      *
In his work on the concept of neofeudalism, Yanis Varoufakis uses the examples
of digital and tech corporations which hold monopolies in all but name—
154                               Quantum History


Amazon for books, Microsoft for software, and so on.6 So is techno-feudalism
already post-capitalism, as Varoufakis claims? Or is, as Noam Yuran claims,7
what some call techno-feudalism actually capitalism at its purest, capitalism
which finally comes to itself (in Hegelese; capitalism at the level of its notion)?
I follow here Alenka Zupančič who8 posited a properly Hegelian identity of the
two terms of the alternative: yes, with techno-feudalism capitalist “comes to
itself,” but since capitalism can function only if it is at a distance from its notion,
it abolishes itself when it reaches its notion.
   What is often largely ignored by the mainstream media is that the digital
warlords like Elon Musk have their counterparts in literal warlords, for example
in the Sudan where there is an ongoing civil war between factions who display
shocking cruelty and indifference towards what we would think of as “their own
people”—or at least people who live in the regions they control. In Sudan, warlords
like Hemedti block humanitarian aid designed for the struggling population,
demanding an exorbitant cut (sometimes as much as 50%) before allowing any
aid to reach the people. This is more and more the reality in which we live: a high-
tech neofeudalism running in parallel with (and linked to, because of the role
played by these corporations in exploiting the natural resources of less developed
countries) an almost medieval, nakedly violent feudalism.
   The split between digital neofeudalism and the neofeudalism of the warlords
does not imply that we should look for some deeper unity of the two: the
truth resides in their split as such. Therein resides the lesson of Fred Jameson:
we should avoid any notion of the enforced deeper unity of different forms
of protest or of violence like a vampire avoids garlic. Back in the early 1980s,
Jameson provided a subtle description of the deadlock of the dialogue between
the Western New Left and the Eastern European dissidents, of the absence
of any common language between them: “To put it briefly, the East wishes to
talk in terms of power and oppression; the West in terms of culture and
commodification. There are really no common denominators in this initial
struggle for discursive rules, and what we end up with is the inevitable comedy
of each side muttering irrelevant replies in its own favorite language.”
   In a similar way, the Swedish detective writer Henning Mankell is a unique
artist of the parallax view. That is to say, the two perspectives—those of the
affluent Ystad in Sweden and Maputo in Mozambique—are irretrievably “out
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                 155


of sync,” so that there is no neutral language enabling us to translate one into
the other, even less to posit one as the “truth” of the other. All one can ultimately
do in today’s conditions is to remain faithful to this split as such, to record it.
Every exclusive focus on the First World topics of late capitalist alienation and
commodification, of ecological crisis, of the new racisms and intolerances, etc.,
cannot but appear cynical in the face of the raw poverty, hunger and violence
endemic to the Third World; on the other hand, attempts to dismiss the
problems of the First World as trivial in comparison with the “real” Third
World permanent catastrophies are no less fake—focusing on the Third World
“real problems” is the ultimate form of escapism, of avoiding a confrontation
with the antagonisms of one’s own society. The gap that separates the two
perspectives IS the truth of the situation.
   The New World Order that is emerging is thus no longer the Fukuyamaist
NWO of global liberal democracy but a NWO of the peaceful co-existence of
different politico-theological ways of life—co-existence, of course, against the
background of the smooth functioning of global capitalism. The obscenity of
this process is that it can present itself as progress in anti-colonial struggle: the
liberal West will no longer be allowed to impose standards on others, all ways
of life will be treated as equal . . . The last gasp of the “end of history” was
Fukuyama’s dream of global liberal-democratic capitalism, and with the
September 11 attacks, that era came to an end.
                                   *
Decades ago, Ayatollah Khomeini wrote: “We’re not afraid of sanctions. We’re
not afraid of military invasion. What frightens us is the invasion of Western
immorality.” The fact that Khomeini talks about fear, about what a Muslim
should fear most in the West, should be taken literally: Muslim fundamentalists
do not have any problems with the brutality of economic and military struggles,
their true enemy is not the Western economic neocolonialism and military
aggressiveness but its “immoral” culture. The same holds for Putin’s Russia
where the conservative nationalists define their conflict with the West as
cultural, in the last resort focused on sexual difference (Russia recently defined
thrLGBT movement as a terrorist organization).
   While the new populist Right advocates a clear vision (return to traditional
values against demands for LGBT+ rights and recognition, reassertion of ethnic
156                               Quantum History


identity against immigrant threats and multiculturalism in general, etc.), the
moderate Left is more and more simply disappearing: unable to propose a vision
that would mobilize people, it is often taking refuge in Cancel Culture excesses.
Our global situation should thus be read as a hologram: there is no longer one
notion of progress dominating (even the golden calf of economic development
is losing this role), we live in an era of the superposition of different futures, of
different universalities (universal visions of progress). So the main options today
are: remnants of the Fukuyama dream, direct religious fundamentalism, and
especially what I cannot but call a moderately-authoritarian soft Fascism: market
capitalism combined with a strong state mobilizing nationalist ideology to
maintain social cohesion—think of Modi’s India.
   My suspicion is that this option will not prove effective against the threats
we are facing today, and that a new form of Communism will have to be
invented. Noam Chomsky often submitted me to a quite brutal critique, but I
must say that I fully subscribe to his prediction of the approaching end of
organized society: “we are at a unique moment in human history. Decisions
that must be made right now will determine the course of future history if
there is to be any human history, which is very much in doubt. There is a
narrow window in which we must implement measures to avert cataclysmic
destruction of the environment, measures that are quite feasible.”9 Ultimately
it is as simple as that: the task that urgently imposes itself is that of universal
solidarity and cooperation among all human communities. The ongoing
impasses with geoengineering make brutally clear the need for global
cooperation if we are to cope with global warming. Affected for years by
prolonged heat waves, the authorities on the West coast of the US plan to spray
gasses in the air above the sea near the coast which would block the heat from
the sun rays to reach the earth. Critics pointed out that this idea is very risky
not only because it may cause unpredictable damage in the area itself: even if
it will work, it may change the overall situation so that heat domes will just be
displaced and will emerge in other parts of the earth, most likely in Western
Europe.10 What lurks on the horizon is that the effects of global warming will
be distributed around the world according to the financial strength of a
country: the rich countries will protect themselves at the expense of the poor
ones, “outsourcing” heat domes to them.
                     The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                157


   There is no higher historical necessity that pushes us in this direction,
history is not on our side, it tends towards our collective suicide. No wonder
many commentators conclude that the battle against global warming, the way
it was conceived, is already lost—the moment has arrived for us to accept this
fact and to rethink our entire strategy. First, we should abandon the notion of
historical progress. As Walter Benjamin wrote, our task today is not to push
forward the train of historical progress but to pull the emergency brake before
we all end in post-capitalist barbarism. The ongoing crises which resonate with
it and with each other in a complex interplay. This interplay is uncontrollable
and full of dangers, and such a risky situation makes our moment an eminently
political one.
   Our present situation is the one described by Cixin Liu in his sci-fi
masterpiece The Three-Body Problem11: a scientist is drawn into a Virtual-
Reality game “Three Body” in which players find themselves on an alien planet,
Trisolaris, whose three suns rise and set at strange and unpredictable intervals:
sometimes too far away and horribly cold, sometimes far too close and
destructively hot, and sometimes not seen for long periods of time. The players
can somehow dehydrate themselves and the rest of the population to weather
the worst seasons, but life is a constant struggle against apparently unpredictable
elements, so that although players try to find ways to build a civilization and
attempt to predict the strange cycles of heat and cold, they are condemned to
destruction . . .
                                       *
Do the latest disturbances in our environment not demonstrate that our Earth
itself is gradually turning into Trisolaris? Devastating hurricanes, droughts
and floods, not to mention global warming, do they all not indicate that we are
witnessing something the only appropriate name for which is “the end of
Nature”? (“Nature” is to be understood here in the traditional sense of a regular
rhythm of seasons, the reliable background of human history, something on
which we can count that it will always be there.) Now that God or Tradition
can no longer play the role of the highest Limit, Nature takes over this role. But
what kind of nature will this be? Even when we imagine global warming, we
are aware that we are approaching a new world in which “England” will
designate a barren dry country, while “Death Valley” will designate a big lake in
158                              Quantum History


California. However, we still picture it as a new stability, with “regular and
repeatable weather patterns”:

   once humanity reaches the limit of carbon output, Earth’s climate stabilizes
   at a new, higher average temperature. This higher temperature is overall bad
   for humans, because it still leads to higher sea levels and more extreme
   weather events. But at least it’s stable: The Anthropocene looks like previous
   climate ages, only warmer, and it will still have.12

However, recent researches find it more probable that “Earth’s climate leads to
chaos. True, mathematical chaos. In a chaotic system, there is no equilibrium
and no repeatable patterns. A chaotic climate would have seasons that change
wildly from decade to decade (or even year to year). Some years would
experience sudden flashes of extreme weather, while others would be
completely quiet. Even the average Earth temperature may fluctuate wildly,
swinging from cooler to hotter periods in relatively short periods of time. It
would become utterly impossible to determine in what direction Earth’s
climate is headed.”13 Such an outcome is not only catastrophic for our survival,
it also runs against our (human) most basic notion of nature, that of repeatable
pattern of seasons.
   Although our planet has only one sun around which it circulates, our
predicament could be called “a six-crises problem”: ecological crisis, economic
imbalances, wars, chaotic migrations, the threat of AI, disintegration of society.
Although the underlying cause of these crises is the dynamic of global
capitalism, the interaction of crises leads to chaos which is no less unpredictable
than the situation on Trisolaris. Do these crises strengthen each other or does
their interaction offer some hope—say, a hope that the ecological crisis will
compel us to move beyond capitalism and war to a social order of global
solidarity? Although Cixin Liu imagines wonderful and/or terrifying new
scientific and technological inventions, he is fully aware that the basic
dimension of our crises is social, the coexistence of different civilizations as
well as the antagonisms within each civilization. So the solution will also have
to be social (a new social organization of our societies), not just technological.
   The first thing to do today is therefore to act accordingly to our predicament:
to prepare for the forthcoming emergency state(s). The paradox is that acting
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                159


like these disasters will happen in all their dimensions (from ecological
catastrophes to wars and digital breakdowns) is the only chance we have to
prevent them from really happening. The Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
recently said: “I know it sounds devastating, especially to people of the younger
generation, but we have to mentally get used to the arrival of a new era. The
prewar era.”14 He is right, although not unconditionally—the situation is still
open, and what we should say is, to be more precise: “If a new world war will
happen, it will be clear that it has begun back in 2022, and that its deployment
was necessary.” Why this strange paradox of retroactivity? Maybe quantum
mechanics offers a solution here—but we should take precautions to avoid the
type of direct progressist reading of quantum mechanics advocated by Thomas
Hertog in his appropriation of Hannah Arendt’s critique of scientific
objectivism:

   A genuine quantum outlook on the universe counters the relentless
   alienating forces of modern science and lets one build cosmology anew
   from an interior viewpoint. . . . Observers have a creative role in cosmic
   affairs, introducing a backward-in-time element. We read the fundamentals
   of the history of the universe from the top down. It turns the apparent
   design of the universe upside down: at a quantum level the universe
   engineers its own biofriendliness. Life and the universe are in some way a
   mutual fit, according to the theory, because, in a deeper sense, they come
   into existence together.15

So it may appear that this state before natural laws set in is a natural counterpart
of freedom: human freedom is a short-circuit to that primordial state before
natural laws. However, can we really say that “at a quantum level the universe
engineers its own biofriendliness”? The collapse of quantum superpositions is
contingent, not the result of a struggle and our decisions on what to focus, so
the engineering of biofriendliness is strictly retroactive: it appears only when,
from our present standpoint as living beings, we look backwards and
reconstruct the line which ends up in our situation. Hertog makes a further
step which I find problematic: he says that biologists can also “use this
knowledge [arrived at through backward-in-time reasoning] to influence
future branchings.” So it is not only that “at the quantum level, the universe
160                               Quantum History


engineers its own biofriendliness,” it is also that “scientists are starting to
envisage hypothetical laws and then engineer systems in which they
emerge,”(261) and this means we (humanity) are at the

   dawn of a new era, the first of its kind in the history of Earth, and perhaps
   even of the cosmos, in which a species attempts to reconfigure and transcend
   the biosphere it has evolved in. Echoing Hannah Arendt, from merely
   undergoing evolution, we are transitioning towards engineering it and, with
   it, our humanities.
                                                                               (263)

This idea misreads Arendt’s intention: when she emphasizes our (humanity’s)
finitude and groundedness in Earth, Arendt speaks as a Heideggerian for
whom the very idea of “engineering evolution and, with it, our humanness”
is the danger we are confronting today: when we engineer nature, inclusive
of our own nature, humanness is over because by definition it cannot be
engineered—we are thrown into it, and Arendt’s Heideggerian point is that
our relationship to reality as an object of engineering is rooted in a certain
disclosure of the meaning of Being which stands for utter self-destructive
nihilism.
   In other words, although Herzog rejects scientific objectivism and
determinism, he is nevertheless coming all too close to classic Marxist
determinism in the sense of Plekhanov, Kautsky and Bukharin: social reality is
totally determined by necessary laws, the fact that we cannot predict the exact
moment of the turmoil of our near future simply means that our knowledge of
reality is incomplete. One should note here how Kautsky slightly relativizes
this determinism with the reference to our knowledge by way of evoking the
(totally misunderstood) notion that freedom is a knowledge of necessity: if we
know (some of) the laws of nature and society, we can manipulate them
(through technological interventions and social engineering) and give them a
spin more benevolent to us. According to this argument, knowing the laws of
nature gives us the “freedom” to build machines, to use electricity, to generate
nuclear energy—we don’t violate the laws of nature here, we just use them for
our purposes . . . I see a double problem in this solution. First, are we really free
when we possess such knowledge or is freedom here just another name for our
                     The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities               161


ignorance (since we simply don’t know how our own “free” decisions are
determined)? Is the implication not that we are somehow exempted from the
laws of nature like an engineer is exempted from the machine it runs? Second,
and much more important, such a view of freedom transposes the model of
the scientific-technological exploitation of nature onto emancipatory social
processes: from an objective distance, a subject learns the laws that regulate
history of his time, and then decides to manipulate history to achieve his (or
his group’s) goals . . . Such a stance has nothing to do with a proper Communist
stance in which truth is accessible only from a subjective engagement.
   The idea that “the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers
would allow us to navigate planet Earth safely and wisely into the future”(266)
is thus suspicious from the Heideggerian standpoint as well as from the
standpoint of quantum mechanics. I find utterly problematic the vision of a
smooth passage from spontaneous/unpredictable quantum collapses to having
an overview of superpositions and then deciding for one among them that fits
our interests:

   Taking a quantum view, the myriad paths forking off into the future are in a
   sense already out there, as a landscape of possibilities. Some futures may
   even appear rather plausible. We should learn from the past, though, that
   chance constantly interferes, leading history to take unexpected twists and
   turns.
                                                                            (264)

This is how a Slovene cultural figure recently described himself: “I am
quantically free, unpredictable.” Pure nonsense, since freedom is not
unpredictable contingency but a “freely” imposed necessity, the act of decision
which cannot be reduced to its causes, while a quantum collapse is by definition
a point at which chance interferes. Furthermore, if our unsurpassable finitude
means anything at all, it means precisely that we a priori cannot acquire “a clear
global vision” of our predicament: to do this we would have, as it were, to step
on our own shoulders and look at ourselves from outside. The top-down
approach means that our evolution has already collapsed into our present state
and we cannot see in advance which superpositions are contained as
non-collapsed in our present state.
162                               Quantum History


   The notion of finitude could also be given a different spin. A simple but
convincing idea circulated recently in some media: since there is a limited
number of different sounds that can be used to compose a song, and since
millions of songs were already written, it is practically impossible today to avoid
plagiarism—basically all possible songs were already written. (This idea can even
be strengthened if we take into account the fact that the combination of sounds
is constrained by cultural—or perhaps, as Steven Pinker claims, even genetic—
limitations to sound combinations which are experienced as pleasant or just
acceptable by our mind.) Does the same hold also for philosophy? Are all basic
philosophical stances already formulated? However, the paradox here is that the
experience of the space of songs as potentially infinite is grounded in our very
finitude—only if we could step out of our finitude and grasp the space of possible
songs from an external view, would it be possible for us to see its finitude. Infinity
is thus strictly a category rooted in our finitude—as in quantum mechanics in
which the multiplicity of superpositions appears infinite precisely because we
cannot step out of ourselves and grasp the totality of the universe “objectively.”
   So how should we use the notion of hologram? In recent quantum
mechanics, it designates the image of an object which catches not only its
actual state but also its interference pattern with other options that were lost
when the actual state imposed itself. (We developed this topic in the first part
of this book.) While I am, of course, not qualified to pass a scientific judgment
on these notions, I find the temptation to apply them to human history
irresistible. Perhaps the supreme example of holographic history is provided
by none other than Marx. Marx is not an evolutionist, he writes history
“top-down,” i.e., his starting point is the contemporary global capitalist order,
and from this point he reads the entire history as a gradual approximation to
capitalism. This is not teleology: history is not guided by capitalism as its telos,
but once capitalism emerges, it provides the key to the entire (pre)history—
here enters Marx’s well-known story (in Grundrisse) of linear development
from prehistorical societies through Asiatic despotism, Antique slavery, and
feudalism to capitalism. But, again, there is no teleological necessity in this
development, it results from a series of contingent collapses of superpositions.
   Along these lines, Alex Taek-Gwang Lee16 conspicuously demonstrates the
dialectical intricacies of the relationship between Western Europe and the Far
                     The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities               163


East during European modernity: it is not the case that dynamic European
capitalism penetrated and triumphed over the inert substantial reality of
the Far East. First, Asia did not experience itself as “Asia” at all before the
European colonization: the notion of “Asia” as the inert domain lacking any
dynamic development is already the product of European colonialism which
(mis)perceived Asia in this way. Second (and even more important), the rise of
so-called “Pan-Asianism” from the late nineteenth century onwards was not
propelled by the desire to avoid the destabilizing madness of European
capitalism and to regain the traditional stability and values of the pre-modern
Asia; on the contrary, it was paradoxically the name of the attempt to leave
behind the inert “Asia” and to modernize it in a way that would integrate the
Western achievements while trying to avoid their self-destructive aspects.
   In a collapse of the wave function, other possible superpositions do not
simply disappear, they leave their traces in the result (the single reality that
emerges in a collapse). Does something similar not hold for political struggles?
When a peaceful negotiation wins over armed resistance, armed resistance is
inscribed in the result. Our media like to mention, as the two examples of
successfully negotiated solutions, the rise of the ANC to power in South Africa
and the establishment of civil rights as the result of peaceful protests led by
Martin Luther King in the US—in both cases, it is obvious that the (relative)
victory of the peaceful negotiations occurred because the establishment feared
the violent resistance (from the more radical wing of ANC as well as of the
American Blacks). In short, negotiations succeeded because of they were
accompanied by a superposed ominous threat of armed struggle.
                                 *
What David Graeber and David Wengrow propose is to abandon capitalism as
the “top” from which we regress to the past that leads to it—the interest of
works like The Dawn of Everything17 is that they provide a kind of quantum
superposition to the actual early development of civilization: a big well-
organized state (Incas) which (for some time, at least) did not follow the line of
neolithic centralization, state authority and class distinctions. The split of the
Inca society into its “anarchist” version and authoritarian version thus captures
the moment when, in a kind of Darwinian struggle, two superposed social
orders were fighting for predominance, and the authoritarian one won.
164                               Quantum History


   Since, as Fredric Jameson suggested, all (hi)stories are ultimately the stories
of the Fall from traditional organic society to chaotic modernity or, in religious
terms, from medieval Catholicism to Protestant individualism, no wonder that
some Catholic theologists dream of a Catholic modernization which would
unite individual freedom with an organic sense of community. Along these
lines, John Millbank advocates a version of alternate modernity whose
possibility is embodied in the line of Christian thought from Acquinas through
Eckhart, Cusa and Kierkegaard, up to Chesterton and Millbank himself. In
refusing the Protestant narrative of progress of Christianity from Orthodoxy
and Catholicism to Protestantism and then Hegel’s atheism, he outlines the
possibility of an alternate development; the implication is also that history is
not a necessary logical/conceptual progress, but a contingent narrative with
multiple trends, so that it could also have turned otherwise:

   It is easy, for example, to imagine that a more humanist reformation might
   have taken place (in 15th–16th-century Spain this had at one stage more or
   less already occurred) such that, while lay life and piety would have moved
   more centre-stage, the specifics of Reformation and Counter-Reformation
   dogmatics would not have dominated the European future. This could well
   have entailed less stand-off between divine grace and human freedom, less
   dualism of nature and grace in theory and of secular and sacred in practice—
   with the upshot that economic and political institutions might have
   remained more ecclesiastically-shaped, even though now more lay-directed.
   . . . Why is it not legitimate to imagine “another” Christian modernity that
   would be linked to the universal encouragement of mystical openness and
   productivity, rather than the separation between a forensic faith and an
   instrumentalizing reason? But as I shall show, such a modernity would
   persist with the alternative dynamism of paradox and not pass over into the
   hypocritical sterility of dialectics.18

While opening up the space for individual freedom and creativity, this alternate
modernity would constrain them to—and (re)inscribe them into—the only
ground on which they can really thrive and avoid nihilistic self-destruction,
that of justice as “identical with objective social harmony” . . . in short, Millbank
imagines an alternate collapse that would stabilize the chaos of modernity.
                     The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities               165


   Along the same lines, some Marxist historians have pointed out that the
explosion of capitalism in early modernity was conditioned by (the contingent
interaction of) two disconnected factors: the availability of surplus financial
wealth (mainly gold from Latin America), and the rise of dispossessed
“free” individuals through the privatization of commons—the surplus wealth
was “invested,” used to employ and exploit dispossessed workers. But this
combination was in no way predestined: history could have taken a different
turn, with the dispossessed poor enslaved or mobilized as a threat to the
existing order, with the surplus of gold just bringing about its devaluation, etc.
                                 *
In a homologous way, there are two opposed ways to conceptualize the
relationship between capitalism and socialism: in the standard Marxist
progressive view, capitalism is the passage from pre-modern societies to
socialism, while for the pro-capitalist view the actual socialism was a passage
from a lower to a higher form of capitalism. So which of these conceptualizations
is correct? Viewed through the lens of the quantum notion of superpositions,
they are both potentially true, since the ongoing struggle is precisely the
conflict to determine which one will prevail. One of the two is not true now
but will have been true once it prevails.
   The lesson of these paradoxes is that subdivisions within a universal genre
always simultaneously split the genre itself. In the Slovene Dictionary of
Literary Language, “man” is defined as a “human being of a male gender,”
while “woman” is defined as a “person of female gender”—why is the difference
not presented as a specific difference within a common species (humankind
OR persons), why is the universal term itself different in each case (man is a
species of human being, woman is a species of person)? “Person” is defined as
“a human individual irrespective of its gender,” while “human being” is defined
as “a being able to think and speak.” In English, “person” is defined as “a human
being regarded as an individual.” Furthermore, “persona” is defined as “the
aspect of someone’s character that is presented to or perceived by others,” or as
a strategic mask of identity in public, the public image of one’s personality, the
social role that one adopts—one can already discern here the link to the well-
known motif of femininity as masquerade. Recall also that we can say about
somebody “as a person, he is nice and warm, but his theory is worthless” (or the
166                                Quantum History


opposite, for that matter: “as a person, he is nasty and despicable, but his
theories are those of a genius”)—here we can easily discern the anti-feminist
spin of characterizing women as persons: they can be warm and pleasant,
although their serious work is worthless . . .
   So a man directly relates to the universality of human species, he is its only
direct embodiment, while a woman is deprived of this dimension of direct
universality and counts only in her individuality. What we encounter here is a
perfect case of the dialectics of genus and species: we don’t have the genus of
human beings with its two major species (men and women)—each species
implies/constructs its own genus (of human beings, of persons). But might we
not also claim that “person” implies a unique inner spiritual wealth and dignity,
while “human being” is an empty abstraction? In this case, I would much prefer
“human being”: there is almost something inhuman in the idea of a human
being who is not a person but just an impersonal subject, while “person” brings
in all the imaginary shit of inner life . . .19
   How should we react to this false neutrality of being-human? It is not
enough to say that women are also fully human. In his perspicuous reflections
on men, women, and trans in Seminar XVIII,20 Lacan plays with the idea
that “there is no sexual relationship” grounds the dimension of freedom. “There
is no sexual relationship” is not symmetrical: if a woman were to exist, she
would be a counterpart to men, as is the case in premodern sexualized
ontologies which oppose masculine and feminine cosmic principles (yin and
yang, etc.). But woman is precisely NOT a symmetrical counterpart to man: a
man is fully caught in the imaginary-symbolic semblance, he fully identifies
with his symbolic identity, his stance is that of displaying his phallic power
aimed at impressing his others, while, in contrast to men, a woman doesn’t
exist, and this non-existence (the fact that a woman is not entirely located
in the symbolic order which provides existence) IS the space of freedom.
We have to take this as far as it can go: there is no neutral subject which is then
subdivided into masculine and feminine—such a subdivision secretly (or not
so secretly) privileges man as a model subject. But from a Lacanian standpoint,
the Cartesian subject (as a model of modern subjectivity) is in its basic
dimension feminine, and being-a-man stands for the escape from the abyss of
freedom.

  We can see here how right Lacan was when he pointed out that progressive
evolution is a new form of teleology. The true break of teleology is only a
top-down history which conceives the linear progress as a retroactive fact, as
the outcome of a backwards-projection of our standpoint into the past. In a
quantum-holographic history, this retroactivity is rendered visible, and all
superpositions that were present in the past and were erased through their
collapse are rendered visible again. In this sense one can even say that Walter
Benjamin, in his Theses on History, proposes a holographic notion of history in
contrast to the predominant progressist-evolutionary version: a present
revolution redeems the past, i.e., it re-actualizes past superpositions lost in
their collapse towards a ruling ideology. Such a direct contact between the
present and the past is timeless in the sense that it by-passes the temporal
causal network connecting the past and the present:

  The past carries with it a temporal index by which it is referred to redemption.
  There is a secret agreement between past generations and the present one.
  Our coming was expected on earth.21
                                  *
In some passages Heidegger expands this approach onto pre-human nature
itself: “I often ask myself—this has for a long time been a fundamental question
for me—what nature would be without man—must it not resonate through
him in order to attain its ownmost potency.”22 Note that this passage is from
the time immediately after Heidegger’s lectures on The Fundamental Concepts
of Metaphysics from 1929–30, where he also formulated a Schellingian
hypothesis that, perhaps, animals are, in a hitherto unknown way, aware of
their lack, of the “poorness” of their relating to the world—perhaps there is an
infinite pain pervading the entire living nature:

  if deprivation in certain forms is a kind of suffering, and poverty and
  deprivation of world belongs to the animal’s being, then a kind of pain and
  suffering would have to permeate the whole animal realm and the realm of
  life in general.23

So when Heidegger speculates about pain in nature itself taken independently of
man,how can we read this claim without committing ourselves to anthropocentric-
168                               Quantum History


teleological thinking? As we already mentioned, the answer was indicated by
none other than Marx who, in his introduction to Grundrisse, wrote:

   “Bourgeois society is the most developed and the most complex historic
   organization of production. The categories which express its relations, the
   comprehension of its structure, thereby also allows insights into the
   structure and the relations of production of all the vanished social
   formations out of whose ruins and elements it built itself up, whose partly
   still unconquered remnants are carried along within it, whose mere nuances
   have developed explicit significance within it, etc. Human anatomy contains
   a key to the anatomy of the ape. The intimations of higher development
   among the subordinate animal species, however, can be understood only
   after the higher development is already known.”24

In short, to paraphrase Pierre Bayard25, what Marx is saying here is that the
anatomy of the ape, although it was formed earlier in time than the anatomy of
man, nonetheless in a way plagiarizes by anticipation the anatomy of man.
There is no teleology here, the effect of teleology is strictly retroactive: once
capitalism is here (emerging in a wholly contingent way), it provides a universal
key for all other formations. Teleology resides precisely in evolutionary
progressism where the key to the anatomy of man is the anatomy of ape.
                                    *
Along these lines, one can also understand why Kant claims that, in some
sense, the world was created so that we can fight our moral struggles in it:
when we are caught in an intense struggle which means everything to us, we
experience it as if the whole world is at stake and will collapse if we fail; the
same holds also when we fear the failure of a love affair. There is no direct
teleology here, our love encounter is the result of a contingent encounter, so it
could easily also not have happened—but once it does happen, it decides how
we experience the whole of reality. When Benjamin wrote that a big
revolutionary battle decides not only the fate of the present but also of all past
failed struggles, he mobilizes the same retroactive mechanism that reaches its
climax in religious claims that, in a crucial battle, not only the fate of us but the
fate of god himself is decided. Therein resides the difference between
evolutionary historicism and the properly historical dialectic in suspense:
                      The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                169


   Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts but also their zero-
   hour [Stillstellung]. Where thinking suddenly halts in a constellation
   overflowing with tensions, there it yields a shock to the same, through which
   it crystallizes as a monad. The historical materialist approaches a historical
   object solely and alone where he encounters it as a monad. In this structure
   he cognizes the sign of a messianic zero-hour [Stillstellung] of events, or put
   differently, a revolutionary chance in the struggle for the suppressed past.26

It is not just that, in such moments of the “dialectics in suspense,” a present
revolutionary moment is torn out from its context as a monad and is
superposed directly on past failed attempts. More importantly, the past
attempts failed (are excluded from the past collapse), which means that the
past is not just the victorious past: what was obliterated when one superposition
won in the past remains in the historical memory, waiting to be reawakened by
a different present moment. In this sense, if revolutions in a progress-oriented
conceptualization mean that for every step society takes “forwards,” there will
be an immense cost to human life and dignity—what I called “squashed birds”
in Against Progress—then the revolution Walter Benjamin envisaged would in
fact be the ultimate counter-revolution: a backlash in which everything that
has been sacrificed returns to wreak its revenge or, at least, to register the price
paid for progress. Spartacus lost (don’t forget that he defended a “primitive”
pre-class society against the “progressive” Rome), but the memory of his slave
rebellion persists as a virtual shadow and provides a holographic depth to later
rebellions.
                                      *
Such a standpoint casts new light on the way we tend to dismiss all forms of
religious fundamentalism. As I have written elsewhere (Zero Point), the
standard “clash of cultures” interpretation of the Russia-Ukraine war as a
conflict between Western liberalism and Russia’s traditional authoritarianism
is deeply misleading. Putin is not a Russian traditionalist, he has to be located
as the last person in the series of brutal modernizers of Russia, after Ivan the
Terrible, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, and Stalin. The last named was a
great admirer of Peter the Great who built a new capital of Russia on the Baltic
sea (Petersburg) to establish a direct link with Western Europe—the human
170                             Quantum History


costs of this project run into hundreds of thousands. Peter’s reforms were
opposed by so-called Old Believers, Eastern Orthodox Christians who
maintained the liturgical and ritual practices of the Russian Orthodox Church
as they were before the reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow between 1652
and 1666. Resisting the accommodation of Russian piety to the contemporary
forms of Greek Orthodox worship, many Old Believers chose death rather
than give up their faith: collective suicides of thousands by fire continued from
the seventeenth century into the nineteenth century. The best known artistic
representation of this rejection is Modest Mussorgsky’s unfinished opera
Khovanshchina which deals with the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky and
the Old Believers against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the young Tsar
Peter who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. After
Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair),
the Old Believers committed mass suicide.
                                      *
One should note that things only really changed with the October Revolution:
the first Soviet government (appointed on October 26, 1917) included several
prominent figures with an Old Believers background: Aleksei Rykov, the
first Commissar on Internal Affairs, Vladimir Milyutin, Commissar for
Agriculture, Alexander Shliapnikov, Commissar for Labour, and Viktor Nogin,
Commissar for Trade and Industry. The Cabinet secretary was Vladimir
Bonch-Bruyevich, a top Russian expert on the Old Believers. Bolsheviks
regarded the Old Believers and sectarians as a kind of social protest, the
opposition against the Tsarist regime—and they were right: it was far more
than a question of competing rituals. Old Believers distrusted the unity of
Church and state (which de facto meant the subordination of Church to state)
and wanted the religious community to remain a self-organization of common
people.
  No wonder that the persecution not only of religion in general but especially
of Old Believers intensified in the Stalin era. Between 1937 and 1940 the
remnants of a few noteworthy Ural Old Believer monasteries were secretly
relocated to the remote lower Yenisei River area in Siberia. As late as 1951 the
Dubches secret Old Believer monasteries were spotted from the air by Soviet
authorities and subsequently demolished; the Old Believers living there were
                        The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities                  171


arrested and all the buildings, icons, and books were burned.27 The
subordination of the Church to the state continues today when Putin has
directly mobilized the Orthodox church into an instrument of his politics—
for example, recall the statements by Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox
Church that there is no need to instill fear around nuclear weapons, as
Christians are not afraid of the end of the world. In a supreme act of obscenity,
Kirill thanked Russian scientists for developing “incredible weapons”: “We
await the Lord Jesus Christ who will come in great glory, destroy Evil, and
judge all nations.”28
   The lesson here is that what may appear as a reactionary move par
excellence—a return to old rigid orthodoxy—can well express class struggle,
i.e., a resistance to new forms of exploitation and domination masked as
“modernization.” The unsurpassed model of such a religious utopia is Canudos,
the outlaw community deep in the Brazilian backlands of Bahia which towards
the end of the nineteenth century became a home to prostitutes, freaks, beggars,
bandits, and the most wretched of the poor headed by Antônio Conselheiro, an
apocalyptic prophet:

   This community developed a “mutual, cooperative and solidary concept of
   work.” In Canudos, which once held a population of 24 thousand people and
   5,200 homes, there was a kind of socio-mystical, religious, assisting,
   community power inspired by the “equalitarian fraternity of the primitive
   Christian communism,” in which there was no hunger. “They all worked
   together. Nobody had anything. Everybody worked the soil, everybody labored.
   Harvested . . . Here’s yours . . . Here’s yours. Nobody got more nor less.” 29

Canudos was a utopian space without money, property, taxes, and marriage,
and it did not disintegrate because of its immanent tensions or because this is
not a “realistic” way to live. It was destroyed by the military forces of the
“progressive” and secular Brazilian government; Canudos’s buildings were
razed to the ground, all its inhabitants massacred, its guiding spirit Conselheiro
beheaded in 1897. Everything is to be endorsed in Canudos, up to the religious
“fanaticism”—it is as if, in such communities, the Benjaminian other side of the
historical Progress, the defeated ones, acquires a space of their own. Utopia
EXISTED here for a brief period of time. This is the only way to account for the
172                              Quantum History


“irrational,” excessive, violence of the destruction of these communities: ALL
inhabitants of Canudos, children and women included, were slaughtered, as if
the very memory of the possibility of freedom had to be erased.
   An obvious counter-argument immediately arises here: does this mean that
we should bracket aggressive Muslim fundamentalism up to ISIS and Boko
Haram alongside Canudos as Benjaminian backlashes against the death march
of progress? No, and the line that separates them is very clear.
                                      *
The paradox is that the problem of populist fundamentalism does not reside in
the fact that it is too identitarian (against which we should emphasize fluidity
and contingency of every identity) but, on the contrary, in the fact that it lacks
proper identity, that its identity clings onto the denial of its constitutive Other.
Are the so-called fundamentalists, be it Christian or Muslim, really
fundamentalists in the authentic sense of the term? What they lack is a feature
that is easy to discern in all authentic fundamentalists, from Tibetan Buddhists
to the Amish in the US: the absence of resentment and envy, the deep
indifference towards the non-believers’ way of life. If today’s so-called
fundamentalists really believe they have found their way to Truth, why should
they feel threatened by non-believers, why should they envy them? When a
Buddhist encounters Western hedonists, he hardly condemns them—he just
benevolently notes that the hedonist’s search for happiness is self-defeating. In
contrast to true fundamentalists, the pseudo-fundamentalists are deeply
bothered, intrigued, fascinated, by the sinful life of the non-believers. One can
feel that, in fighting the sinful other, they are fighting their own temptation.
This is why the so-called Christian or Muslim fundamentalists are a disgrace
to true fundamentalism.
   Let’s take a closer look at the Tibetans who are extremely self-centered: “To
them, Tibet was the center of the world, the heart of civilization.”30 What
characterizes the European civilization is, on the contrary, precisely its
ex-centered character—the notion that the ultimate pillar of Wisdom, the
secret agalma, the spiritual treasure, the lost object-cause of desire, which we
in the West long ago betrayed, could be recuperated out there, in the forbidden
exotic place. Colonization was never simply the imposition of Western values,
the assimilation of the Oriental and other Others to the European Sameness; it
                          The Hologram of Conflicting Universalities             173


was always also the search for the lost spiritual innocence of OUR OWN
civilization.
   This story begins at the very dawn of the Western civilization, in Ancient
Greece: for the Greeks, Egypt was the mythic place of lost ancient wisdom.
And the same holds today in our own societies: the difference between the
authentic fundamentalists and the Moral Majority perverted fundamentalists
is that the first (like, say, the Amish in the USA) go along very well with their
American neighbours, since they are simply centered on their own world, not
bothered by what goes on out there, among “them,” while the Moral Majority
fundamentalist is always haunted by the ambiguous attitude of horror/envy
with regard to the unspeakable pleasures in which the sinners engage—this
attitude pushes them towards acts of violence like bombings and slaughters.
   Back to today’s Russia: Putin’s regime has thus nothing to do with any
authentic ancient Russian spirituality that rejects European modernization. It
uses a fantasized “Eurasia” to legitimize its own project of brutal modernization
and conquest. This is why we should not dismiss Russia as a country caught in
a neo-conservative vortex resisted only by a tiny liberal minority: those who
want to free Russia of Putinism will not be able to do it without awakening the
dormant authentic Russian spirituality which resists authoritarian state power.
   And even further back to Graeber and Marx, this is why the superposition
of a more “democratic” Inca society persists and gets resuscitated in later
rebellions against centralized despotic state power. In the linear progression
of slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, each of these actual nodal points is
accompanied by a series of superpositions: feudalism is not just feudalism but
all that could have happened but was obliterated by its rise. And, back to
quantum mechanics, this is why superpositions (multiple paths of a particle)
are not just our “bookkeeping devices” that enable us to calculate reality but
part of reality itself.
   We don’t change the past facts, we just locate them into a different symbolic
context, we change their meaning. So we do not have a Whole which comprises
its parts: each part comprises multiple universalities between which we are
forced to choose. This brings us back to the basic premise of holography: the
whole is a part of its part, i.e., a part is composed of all the (other) parts of its
whole. (Capitalism is only a part of history, a moment in the global development,
174                              Quantum History


but it imposed itself as the prism through which we see the entire development as
steps gradually leading to it.) True history is thus not a gradual development of
parts, but a series of shifts in how its “whole” is itself (re)structured. We get a
series of Wholes because the actual Whole is inaccessible, and the only Whole
we can reach is a negative one, the impossibility to reach the Whole inscribed
into reality itself.
   Do we not find the same parallax duality in Heidegger’s notion of history of
Being as the history of disclosures? Heidegger sometimes emphasizes the
abyssal contingency of disclosures (they just happen, with no deeper logic or
ground), and he sometimes comes close to the language of teleology, presenting
the history of the West as the gradually growing oblivion of manifestness, the
oblivion which culminates in today’s scientific/technological global order
which poses a threat to the very dimension of disclosure/manifestness
grounded in human finitude.
   Our predicament confronts us with the deadlock of the contemporary
“society of choice.” We pride ourselves for living in a society in which we freely
decide about things which matter. However, we find ourselves constantly in the
position of having to decide about matters that will fundamentally affect our
lives, but without a proper foundation in knowledge. Such a situation is
properly frustrating: although we know that it all depends on us, we cannot
ever predict the consequences of our acts—we are not impotent, but, quite on
the contrary, omnipotent, without being able to determine the scope of our
powers. While we cannot gain full mastery over our bio-sphere, it is
unfortunately in our power to derail it, to disturb its balance so that it will run
amok, swiping us away in the process.

  Can artificial intelligence
       really think?


The way capital controls our lives is perhaps best exemplified by BlackRock, a
mega-company that works discreetly, avoiding too much public exposure. It
has nearly $10 trillion in assets under management. That’s more than the GDP
of every country in the world except for the United States and China. BlackRock
is a top shareholder across a wide range of global industries that include oil
and gas, technology, retail, big banks, healthcare, weapons manufacturing, and
much more. All this makes BlackRock one of the most powerful corporate
actors on the planet, whose influence touches every aspect of our daily lives.
Although the CEO Larry Fink has attempted to brand the firm as sensitive to
global challenges like climate change, structural racism, and public health,
BlackRock’s investment activity and governance practices drive business
operations that directly harm Black and Indigenous communities and people
of color around the world. BlackRock is one of the world’s biggest corporate
drivers of climate chaos and ecocide—it is a major culprit behind the global
climate breakdown. BlackRock also remains one of the world’s biggest investors
in the coal industry. In sum: there may be no greater existential crisis facing
humanity than the global climate catastrophe and BlackRock is playing an
active role in perpetuating this crisis. BlackRock also props up many companies
whose products are tied to gun violence in the United States and endless war
and occupation of places like in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine.1
  As expected, AI plays a key role in how Blackrock operates: Blackrock built
and uses Aladdin (Asset, Liability and Debt and Derivative Investment

                                                                           175
176                             Quantum History


Network), an electronic system which, already back in 2013, handled about
$11 trillion in assets (including BlackRock’s $4.1 trillion assets), which was
about 7% of the world’s financial assets, and kept track of about 30,000
investment portfolios. As of 2020, Aladdin managed $21.6 trillion in assets.
The network in Wenatchee, Washington State, consists of around 6,000
computers, and the software uses these computers to analyze global economic
data, stock market prices and numerous other economic factors. For example,
sudden changes in government, weather conditions or possible disasters are
also taken into account when evaluating portfolios.2 What all this means is that
programs like Aladdin are not neutral: their decisions are based on premises
which largely ignore environmental and human damage. Blackrock is arguably
the ultimate figure of techno-feudalism where the feudal master itself operates
blindly, as an algorithm which ignores personal quirks of the ancient feudal
lords. But the main problem with such a “realist” approach which focuses on
economic interests is not only that it leads to a cynical distance and precludes
serious political engagement: its ultimate message is “don’t struggle, your fight
will just help military industry (or medical industry or . . .).” It also does not
provide a true dialectical mediation, a true analysis of how a form of ideology
arises—such a direct foundation of ideologico-political stances and practices
in economic interests remains external, it ignores how individuals subjectively
perceive their predicament and mystify it. Where is the causal link between
objective “interests of the capital” and populist militarism as a subjective
stance? An individual cannot stand on its own shoulders, becoming aware of
the “interests of the capital” and then translating them into an ideological
stance.
   Many of the fake “Leftists” who blame NATO for the Ukrainian war react to
it with a surprisingly vulgar economic reductionism: the NATO support of
Ukraine reflects the interests of the Western military-industrial complex and the
war goes on to satisfy these interests . . . (To avoid a misunderstanding, yes,
economic relations matter.3 There is, however, a limit to such a vulgar economist
approach: at the end of this road, we will be told that the Nazis perpetrated the
Holocaust in order to boost the profits of IG Farben which was making the gases
to kill the Jews . . . True, war can help the economy—remember that the US got
out of the Great Depression only during World War II; however, the enormous
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                177


amounts spent on arms could also be used for ecology and social solidarity
without automatically causing an economic crisis.) In the case of Ukrainian
resistance to Russian aggression, can we seriously claim that the desperate
Ukrainians who were ready to fight for their survival were somehow just
“reflecting” the interests of the Western military-industrial complex?
   Or, let’s take a negative example: were the Nazis fighting till 1945, killing
millions and sacrificing hundreds of thousands of their own, just to satisfy the
interests of capital? There is a complex interplay between these two levels—the
idea of an evil ruling class aware of its economic interests and manipulating
the crowd through its control of ideological apparatuses is far too naïve. Yes,
the Nazis committed horrors because they were deeply immersed in an
ideological mystification, but this mystification was immanent to their
ideology: yes, they lied to themselves when they projected the cause of evil into
the Jews, but many of them were fully committed to this lie, ready to die for it.
Here psychoanalysis enters: ideology is not a direct reflection of some external
economic processes, it is divided in itself, it has its own “unconscious.” As Marx
knew it when he spoke about “commodity fetishism,” ideology is not external
to socio-economic processes, it is inscribed into their very core. There are no
objective “interests of capital,” these “interests” are always-already ideologically
mediated.
   When we talk about AI and war, we should begin with a fact that is often
ignored—not just how AI is already widely used to regulate military activities,
but how the machinery that supports AI can in itself be a target of military
operations. In the third week of July 2014, an unexpected malfunctioning in a
specific aspect of Windows programs brought thousands of digital programs
and links to a standstill, and these disruptions in the virtual universe had dire
consequences in our real lives: they have hit airlines, banks, businesses, schools,
governments, and even emergency services.4 This fairly limited accident made
it clear how our daily lives are already regulated through digital processes to
such an extent that a more global outage of the web would in all probability
cause a regression of our daily lives into an uncontrollable violence of the new
barbarism. (If civilization used to be three meals away from anarchy, it is
probably now three Cloudflare meltdowns away . . .) No wonder, then, that
Western powers are worried about Russian submarines closely monitoring the
178                              Quantum History


trans-Atlantic cables—in all probability they have orders to destroy them in
the case of an all-out war. Plus we can be sure that the US and China are
making similar plans. There is in all probability a new mode of MAD (Mutually
Assured Destruction) operative even now: superpowers definitely try to
implant into the AI systems of its opponents digital viruses which, when
activated, could immobilize the entire life of a country (no electricity, water,
etc.). Since both sides know this, they are well aware that if they activate these
viruses they will immediately suffer the same devastating consequences.
   This prospect opens up a vision of global war that differs from our usual
imaginings (drones dropping bombs, nuclear projectiles hitting our cities . . .):
what if we will simply awaken one morning and look through the window
where everything will appear normal, the sun shining, the birds singing.
However, we will all of a sudden realize not that there will be a war but that the
war already took place and is in some sense over—we already lost it, and the
eventual “real” battles will be just its aftermath. Moreover, most of these battles
will take place not against the enemy but in our society itself, among desperate
individuals and groups fighting for survival. So yes, war reduced to a
technological process regulated by AI is terrifying, but it still remains rooted in
social relations. To cite a recent example, it was reported that a significant role
in the bombing of Gaza has been played by an AI-based programme called
“Lavender,” which during the first few weeks of the war designated as many as
37,000 Palestinian individuals as suspected militants and their homes as
targets for possible airstrikes. It was reported that the army acted upon
Lavender’s “kill lists” with no requirement to check the basis of the information,
despite knowing that the system had an error rate as high as 10% and

   is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose
   connection to militant groups, or no connection at all. Moreover, the Israeli
   army systematically attacked the targeted individuals while they were in
   their homes—usually at night while their whole families were present—
   rather than during the course of military activity. . . . In addition, when it
   came to targeting alleged junior militants marked by Lavender, the army
   preferred to only use unguided missiles, commonly known as “dumb”
   bombs (in contrast to “smart” precision bombs), which can destroy entire
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?             179


  buildings on top of their occupants and cause significant casualties. “You
  don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people . . .,” said one
  of the intelligence officers.5

Incidentally, what this last fact means is that if the target to be bombed is
classified as unimportant, the chance that his entire family or house will be
killed or destroyed is much greater than if the target is a top Hamas member.
But the main point is the following one. The Israeli propaganda always
emphasizes the direct personal brutality of the Hamas attackers: they rape, kill,
and abduct in a direct physical contact with their victims, enjoying the fear and
pain inflicted on them. The implication is that the IDF procedure is somehow
less horrible: all the work is done by AI, the soldier just presses a button far
behind the front. But is the impersonal AI process that regulates the bombing
and killing of thousands in some sense not even more terrifying than direct
face-to-face killing? Is the idea that such a killing somehow de-culpabilizes the
soldier who presses the button not the ultimate obscenity, the first case of a
genocide done by AI?
  From the ancient times of Bhagavadgita and Zen, military doctrine advises
soldiers that they must act with inner peace and distance from external reality:
avoiding direct subjective engagement, not identifying with one’s own acts, is
the key to success. This distance is becoming direct reality today when more
and more military operations are done from a safe distance: the soldier is
sitting far from the front and just pushes buttons or moves a joystick in front
of a screen to direct a rocket or a drone. A Ukrainian gamer-turned-drone
operator said video games have helped him fight Russians. He told Reuters his
mother said his gaming would come to nothing—but now he’s making deadly
drone strikes. It was reported years ago that the notorious Wagner Group was
also searching for experienced gamers.6
  At an even more basic level, this brings us to the topic that haunts our media
in the Past decades: can Artificial Intelligence actually think?7 This debate has
been mostly dominated by the idea that AI can only imitate human intelligence,
reducing it to abstract forms of reasoning, missing the true “spirit” of human
intelligence. AI is thinking reduced to automatization: machines can adapt
themselves to new situations, they can learn new things and new procedures,
180                              Quantum History


they can perform complex operations far beyond the scope of a human mind.
But AI is not really alive, it is literally artificial, a grey mechanistic shadow of
human intelligence in which none of the sudden sparks which characterize the
working of a human mind can ever ignite . . . insofar as we reflect in this way,
our victory over machines is secured in advance.
   Big companies are not just investing enormous sums of money but also
using colossal amounts of energy to develop AI machines with such enhanced
intelligence that their functioning will be beyond our (human) reach. The
problem is that the amount of energy needed to build such machines would
compel us to abandon and infringe all the limits and caps we need to observe
to prevent global warming and other ecological catastrophes, i.e., to maintain
ecological sustainability—it is simply not possible to meet AI energy demands
while keeping pace with climate goals. Here is a foretaste of our future:

   The world is facing a looming global water crisis that threatens to “spiral out
   of control” as increased demand for water and the intensifying impacts of
   the climate crisis put huge pressure on water resources, a UN report has
   warned. The consequences will be even more catastrophic without urgent
   action. The water crisis threatens more than 50% of global food production
   and risks shaving an average of 8% off countries’ GDPs by 2050, with much
   higher losses of up to 15% projected in low-income countries, the report
   found.8

So what choice are we to make here? The former Google CEO Eric Schmidt
advocates a radical solution which, while it may appear crazy, promises to solve
all big problems we (humanity) are confronting: since “we’re not going to hit
the climate goals anyway, because we’re not organized to do it,” let’s ignore
sustainability and invest everything, inclusive of enormous amounts of energy,
into new unpredictably strong AI machines. There are many arguments for the
claim that we’re not going to hit the climate goals—recall just what goes on in
Finland: “Natural sinks of forests and peat were key to Finland’s ambitious
target to be carbon neutral by 2035. But now, the land has started emitting
more greenhouse gases than it stores.”9 In short, one of our basic strategies to
reach carbon neutrality thus unexpectedly backfired, for reasons which are not
yet clear.
                        Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                 181


   Not only this: the fact that humanity is approaching (ecological, military,
social) self-destruction means that the only truly rational way out is to abdicate
our agency and decision-making power, to allow the new AI machines to control
and regulate our social life, although they will be doing this in ways that will not
be transparent to us. Schmidt’s proposal cannot but remind us of the old Groucho
Marx advice: “Are you in some legal trouble? Hire a lawyer—you will be in even
more trouble, but you will have a lawyer to take care of them.” We are in trouble
due to our environmental predicament, so let’s use artificial intelligence—we
will be even more in trouble, but we will have AI to take care of it . . .10
                                   *
While the consequences of our explosively progressing immersion into the
digital universe as our life-world are not yet clear, there seems to be good reasons
to reject the optimist view that we will get used to it in the same way we got used
to writing and other externalizations of our thought processes. Does a permanent
“conversation” with ChatGPT not gradually diminish our ability to think? It not
only makes available to us an endless flow of data, it also more and more takes
over from us the very process of reasoning. Are we then not at a unique moment
in history when our mental ability begins to shrink, so that the summit is behind
us and we are on a way to decline?11 We should thus abandon the boring
obsession with the question: will AI serve us or will we be dominated by AI? We
should also abandon the no less boring search for the right balance between
technological development and concern for our environment—all the formulas
of “green passage” which will allow us to have our cake and eat it are a fake. There
are only two serious options: the one advocated by Kohei Saito (radical
de-growth) and the one advocated by Schmidt for whom, instead of being afraid
that we’ll be controlled by all-powerful machines, we should endorse our
surrender to machines as the only solution available to us. So what about
environmental threats? Schmidt claims that AI will solve its own problems when
it comes to pushing sustainability: the new AI-generated technology might
actually solve the environmental issues we (humanity) are unable to cope with
in an appropriate way . . . I think we should follow this line of thought to the end,
to its logical conclusion, and accept that, if AI will decide it is in the interest of
life on earth (or of its own reproduction) to eliminate us (humans), so be it!12
                                           *
182                                Quantum History


According to the common sense view, AI is the culmination of intruding
mediators which interpose themselves between us, humans, and reality in
which we live. Instead of experiencing ourselves as embedded in our natural
environment, “breathing” with it, we interpose new and new obstacles
(machines, screens, virtual realities . . .) that separates us from reality . . . There
is, of course, an aspect of truth in this view, not the least among them being the
prospect that science may give rise to new forms of life which may endanger
the very existence of (not only human) life on earth:

   World-leading scientists have called for a halt on research to create
   “mirror life” microbes amid concerns that the synthetic organisms
   would present an “unprecedented risk” to life on Earth. The international
   group of Nobel laureates and other experts warn that mirror bacteria,
   constructed from mirror images of molecules found in nature, could
   become established in the environment and slip past the immune defenses
   of natural organisms, putting humans, animals and plants at risk of lethal
   infections.13

However, this very real threat should not blind us to the fact that any AI
machine, even if it is (for us) unimaginably strong and efficient, is simply part
of reality, it fits into it, while the only stain in reality, a disturbing element in it,
is us, humanity. Here we should learn from Chaplin whose figure of Tramp is
a stain embodied. His City Lights opens with showing

   a group of well-heeled citizens and dignitaries around a monument to
   “Peace And Prosperity” that is about to be unveiled. After a series of long-
   winded speeches, where Chaplin effectively uses sound to convey the
   meaninglessness of their words, the monument is unveiled to reveal the
   Little Tramp asleep in the arms of one of the monument’s statues. What
   follows is a hilarious scene, with an apologetic Tramp getting himself near
   impaled on the sword of one of the statues, followed by a perplexed and
   angry crowd holding onto their wrath when the National Anthem is played.
   The Tramp tries to be upstanding, even in his ridiculous position but cannot
   contain himself, as he soon uses the features of the monument in a farcical
   display before making his getaway . . .14
                      Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?               183


The Tramp stands here for the human subject as such: not an abstract gaze
observing reality but something interposed between our gaze and its proper
object, something that disturbs our clear view. Lacan’s premise is that there is
no clear view: when we look at something there is always a stain in what we
see, and this stain is the stand-in for ourselves, for our gaze, the blind spot in
the image from which the image returns the gaze and looks back at us . . . One
can only imagine what Chaplin were to do with Donald Trump if he were to be
alive today, how he would reshoot the famous scene from The Great Dictator in
which Hynkel (Hitler) plays with a globe-balloon which then explodes above
his feet. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin based his identification with Hynkel/
Hitler on their very similar moustaches, while today he would rely on the
obvious vocal similarity between Trump and Tramp. So what if, instead of a
globe-balloon, Trump would have played with a balloon shaped as a big vagina,
squeezing and kicking it obscenely till it would explode in his face (a reference
to his “I can grab pussies”)? Or maybe he would play with his ultimate
obscenity: his special edition of the shamelessly Americanized Bible?
   The field of AI has seen a remarkable evolution over the past several decades,
with two distinct paradigms emerging—symbolic AI and subsymbolic AI.
Symbolic AI, which dominated the early days of the field, focuses on the
manipulation of abstract symbols to represent knowledge and reason about it.
Subsymbolic AI, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of numerical
representations and machine learning algorithms to extract patterns from
data. The strengths of symbolic AI lie in its ability to handle complex, abstract,
and rule-based problems, where the underlying logic and reasoning can be
explicitly encoded. In contrast to symbolic AI, subsymbolic AI focuses on the
use of numerical representations and machine learning algorithms to extract
patterns from data. This approach, also known as “connectionist” or “neural
network” AI, is inspired by the workings of the human brain and the way it
processes and learns from information.
   Subsymbolic AI systems rely on machine learning algorithms, such as deep
learning, to automatically extract features and patterns from large datasets,
without the need for explicit rule-based programming. Knowledge in
subsymbolic AI is typically distributed across the weights and connections of
the neural network, rather than being localized in specific symbols or rules.
184                              Quantum History


The strengths of subsymbolic AI lie in its ability to handle complex,
unstructured, and noisy data, such as images, speech, and natural language.
This approach has been particularly successful in tasks like computer vision,
speech recognition, and language understanding. The paradox is that while
subsymbolic AI is often perceived as closer to the human mind (it is modeled
on neural connections, it is more sensitive to blurred and ambiguous regions
that it tries to decipher, it can establish much faster a dialogic relationship
with a human agent who perceives it as a pseudo-human partner, etc.), the
reality is almost the opposite: symbolic AI uses explicit, human-readable
representations of knowledge, while subsymbolic AI relies on distributed,
numerical representations that are more opaque to human understanding.15
The prevalent (and correct, I think) stance is that subsymbolic AI is really a
version of symbolic AI: it is ultimately a symbolic AI which is made so that it
(appears to) act(s) in a subsymbolic way.
   Another term used for subsymbolic AI is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
a structure of units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the
neurons in a brain. These units are connected by edges, which model the
synapses in a brain. They are used for various tasks, including predictive
modeling, adaptive control, and solving problems in artificial intelligence. They
can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions from a complex and
seemingly unrelated set of information.16 In this way, they do not imitate human
thinking: what we are really encountering lately are machines which don’t think
like humans: they really do think, but not simply better than us—they think in
a way which is radically foreign to human thinking.17 From this perspective, the
organic human intellectuality (our inner reflection or contemplation)—in other
words, what I referred to above as the sparks of spirit—is not a sign of our
priority or advantage over AI but a sign of its inferiority:

   Human intellectuality is seriously limited, it has already reached its zenith
   early in the development of the species homo sapiens. Today we do not
   think more deeply or in a more sophisticated way than the oldest Antique
   philosophers, and The Iliad can move us in the same way it would have
   moved us three thousand years ago. . . . the only dimension of human
   intelligence which effectively develops beyond slow and unpredictable
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                185


   rhythms of biological evolution is technical intelligence. This means that
   human intelligence can expand and perfect itself only through its
   autonomization from organic intellectuality through technological self-
   overcoming.18

I disagree with this conclusion for two reasons. First, there is nothing natural
or organic in “intellectuality”; intellectuality is rather a sign of the radical
rupture between humans and animals, it breaks and disturbs organic rhythms.
Second, yes, there effectively is something constrained or limited in the very
foundation of human intellectuality, but it is precisely this limitation (what
Heidegger called finitude) which gives birth to human transcendence, to
specific human spirituality. If this limitation is abolished, we enter a totally
different domain. So we should reverse the terms: “human” is more than
“over-man.” What human intellectuality implies is a gap between inside and
outside, between so-called inner life and outside reality, and it is not clear what
will happen (or, rather, is happening) with this gap in developed AI—in all
probability, it will disappear, since machines are part of reality. The fact that a
subject has no fixed place in the symbolic order becomes most palpable in the
case of copyists, those who just literally transcribe what already exists in the
symbolic universe—the place of a copyist in a symbolic order

   is his not having a place. If Flaubert’s copyists, as read by Foucault, stand for
   a successful alienation whereby the subject disappears into an alien element,
   the anonymity of pure discourse, Kafka’s universe is one of failed alienation
   where the subject cannot settle into the order in which it’s caught, since the
   subject is nothing other than a gap in this order.19

Copying is a procedure of traditional bureaucracy where handwriting (and
maybe typing machines, including photocopiers) predominates. But what
happens with the digitalization of our lives where data (information) exists
predominantly in digital clouds and are no longer part of our physical reality?
Can we still call this situation a successful alienation in which subjects
disappear in the anonymity of pure discourse? If we add to this the self-
organizing and multiplying artificial intelligence which not only follows our
orders and choices but manipulates us in advance, deciding which choices are
186                              Quantum History


given to us? In many domains, from choosing a partner to medical diagnosis
or a decision where to invest money, AI does a better job than an average
marriage counsellor, doctor or banker. Am I in such a situation reduced to an
object and/or pretext for the self-reproducing digital entity, or does it open up
a new space of freedom for me?
   To avoid a misunderstanding, all this in no way precludes the option that
thinking machines will develop a subjectivity in some sense even more human
than that of humans. The two Blade Runner movies, especially the second one
(2049), address this problem: they both focus on a replicant (Deckard, K) who
is not sure if he is a true human or a replicant with implanted memories. Their
radical doubt which reduces them to a Cartesian cogito (Deckard-Descartes)
not sure if the reality around him is real or just a fake orchestrated by an
evil spirit, makes them in some sense more human than the “true” humans
themselves: yes, they are “inhuman,” but this inhumanity means that they
openly assume their reduction to the void of a pure cogito—what makes them
more human than humans is their radical doubt, a feature totally foreign to
thinking machines. In contrast to this radical doubt, “true” humans remain
embedded in their finite situation, in their historical symbolic context. In short,
“true” humans remain persons, while self-doubting replicants are ready to
confront the abyss of pure subjectivity.
   To see this distinction clearly, one should avoid two opposed traps: not only
the trap of naïve realism but also the trap of fictionalism, i.e., of the claim that
we live in symbolic fictions behind which there are only other fictions, with no
ultimate grounding in the real. David Chalmers, well-known for his claim we
cannot exclude the possibility that we live in a simulated world, wisely resists
this idealist temptation and insists on a reality independent of our minds: even
if our common reality is the product of a complex machine which controls our
brains (as it happens in the movie The Matrix), every simulation has to be
generated by a simulating machine which is part of reality (although it is
possible that this reality is radically different from our normal reality).20 Does
this bring him close to quantum mechanics which (in its predominant version,
at least) posits that our everyday reality is grounded in quantum processes
which obey a different logic? In other words, is there a link between virtual in
the sense of VR (inclusive AR)—an effect of reality constructed by digital
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                187


machines—and virtual in the sense of wave oscillations which are not part
of our reality (they become this only through collapse)? When quantum
mechanics claims that what we experience as our ordinary reality is not what
reality really is, that it is the product of another level of reality, the QU, which
obeys different laws, is it in some sense suggesting that the status of our
ordinary reality is virtual?
   I think this parallel is problematic: in contrast to quantum oscillations, a
digital machine that sustains AR and VR is fully part of our ordinary reality,
with no quantum waves involved, no superpositions and collapses. Plus there
is a third domain of virtuality—in some precise sense, what we experience as
reality is always-already augmented even if no digital machinery sustains it:
the symbolic order always and by definition provides a partial/twisted view on
reality—the reality we see and interact with is always and by definition
“augmented” by our virtual supplements. Recall Pokemon Go, a location-based
AR game released in July 2016: virtual creatures (“Pokémon”) appear on the
screen as if they were in the same real-world location as the player. This AR
mode is what makes Pokémon Go different from other games: instead of
taking us out of the real world and drawing us into the artificial virtual space,
it combines the two: we look at reality and interact with it through the fantasy-
frame of the digital screen, and this intermediary frame supplements reality
with virtual elements which sustain our desire to participate in the game, push
us to look for them in a reality which, without this frame, would leave us
indifferent . . . sounds familiar? Of course it does. What the technology of
Pokemon Go externalizes is simply the basic mechanism of ideology—at its
most basic, ideology is the primordial version of “augmented reality.”
   In continental philosophical tradition, the name for the “+” which makes
our everyday reality a “reality+” is the transcendental dimension: the horizon
of meaning which enframes our perception of and interaction with reality.
Chalmers ignores this + constitutive of our everyday reality because his
approach remains that of analytic philosophy. Chalmers’s Reality+21 definitely
deserves a closer look: it deals with ontological, epistemological, and
deontological problems of virtual and simulated realities. The density of its
analytic argumentation is breathtaking: I’ve never read a book with such a
breadth of topics in which almost every page brings a new specific line of
188                              Quantum History


argumentation (although one must add that all this argumentation remains
within the frame of analytic rational argumentation). For me as a philosopher
the most interesting segment is Part 7 (“Foundations”) where Chalmers
focuses on the fundamentals of his approach.
   The ultimate dilemma here is: simulations and virtual realities are based on
some mathematical algorithm (say, a chair I see when I am immersed into
virtual reality exists independently of my mind, it is real, but its reality resides
in digital bits which regulate its appearance in VR); however, if we live in a
simulated world, i.e., if our ordinary reality is also a simulation regulated by
algorithms of some higher digital intelligence—a hypothesis Chalmers
considers as a possible and even probable option—and if there are even
multiple levels of simulations (simulation in simulation in simulation . . .), is
there an ultimate level of reality outside simulations, or is all reality based on
some mathematical algorithm (which can, obviously, also be interpreted as a
divine mind)?
   Rather than providing a clear answer to this dilemma, Chalmers begins
with the basic problem of the philosophy of language: how do words relate to
things they designate? Analytic philosophy oscillates here between two
extremes: descriptivism versus causal theory. For descriptivism, the meaning
of a word resides in the set of features it is associated with in our mind (chair
is a wooden, metal or plastic object on 3 or 4 legs and a platter on which a
person can sit), and this word refers to an empirical object only if this object
fits the set of features. The causal theory, on the contrary, posits a direct causal
relationship between an object and the word that designates it: in an act of
primal baptism, a word is directly attached to an object, and this object remains
what this word refers to even if, in a later experience or scientific discovery, we
realize that the true features of the object in question are totally different from
what we thought.
   Chalmers approaches this topic when he deals with the meaning of words
in simulated or multiple realities. Yes, meaning resides in environment, not “in
the head,” but this environment is not just what we usually perceive as external
reality. To return to our example of a chair in virtual reality: its referent is not
an illusory chair that exists only virtually but also the bytes in a digital cloud
which cause and regulate its appearance. So why should we use the same word
                        Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?               189


for a chair in our everyday reality and for a chair in virtual reality? Is it not
obvious that the entities are substantially different? Would the use of the same
word not be justified only in the case of a subject who is so fully immersed in
simulated virtual reality that s/he takes it for ordinary reality? After a detailed
set of arguments and counter-arguments, Chalmers arrives at a position he
calls structuralism—here is his own brief definition:

   The thesis that scientific theories are equivalent to structural theories, cast
   in terms of mathematics plus connections to observation. Epistemic
   structuralism says that science tells us only the structure of reality (though
   there may be more to reality than this). Ontic structural realism says that
   reality itself is entirely structural.
                                                                              (470)

The difference between epistemic structuralism and ontic structuralism is
secondary with regard to the main point Chalmers is making. He challenges us
to imagine two realities which are experienced by people who live in them as
exactly the same; imagine then that a scientist coming from outside did a
chemical analysis of water in each of the two realities and discovered that, while
in our reality water has the chemical structure of H20, in the parallel universe it
has a different chemical structure, XYZ. Although the object the experience of
water refers to is different in the two realities, one can justify the use of
the same word “water” in both cases because this object plays exactly the
same structural role in both cases . . . Chalmers then extends the argument to
simulated worlds: imagine our ordinary reality and its perfect simulation. If in
such a simulation “water” (which is effectively a network of digital bits) plays
the same structural role as our “real” water, the use of the same word is justified.
Chalmers pushes this argument to its conclusion and argues that AI and
simulated entities also can think and possess consciousness. Here is the logical
form of his argumentation:

   1. Our physical theories are structural theories.
   2. If we’re in Nonsim(ulated) Universe, our physical theories are true.
   3. Sim Universe has the same structure as Nonsim Universe.
   4. So: if we’re in Sim Universe, our physical theories are true.22
190                               Quantum History


From my standpoint, however, what Chalmers misses is exactly structuralism—
not in his own standard meaning of a formal structure that can be actualized
in different materials (in the same way that, say, Shakespeare’s Hamlet is the
same play if we see it in a theatre, read it in a book or watch its cinematic
version), but in the strict meaning of French structuralism which exploded
in the 1960s. The basic lesson of French structuralism is that a structure
is always characterized by a minimal reflexivity: a structure is never pure,
by definition it includes as one of its elements a stand-in for its own
constitutive impossibility, for what is excluded from its space. For example,
Marx’s overall vision of history is that of a linear succession of “progressive”
modes of social development from primitive societies through Asiatic mode
of production, slavery, feudalism, capitalism up to Socialism and Communism.
However, a close analysis shows that “Asiatic mode of production” is an empty
category into which Marx threw whatever didn’t fit his Eurocentric logic of
history.
   For Lacan, the same notion of structure holds for the symbolic order
itself—this is what he aims at with his circular definition of signifier as that
which represents the subject for another signifier. Lacan’s premise is that
subject’s representation, its expression in the symbolic order, always fails,
there is a gap between subject and the symbolic order; however, subject
doesn’t precede this failure, it emerges through the failure of its symbolic
representation—in short, a subject tries to fully express itself in words, it fails,
and this failure IS subject. The temporal circularity is crucial here, in a nice
case of what Hegel called “absolute recoil”: an entity is a retroactive effect of its
failure to be what it is. This failure has to be inscribed into the symbolic order
as a special signifier, a signifier which stands for what a signifier cannot
represent. What eludes words is thus not reality in all its wealth but subject
itself. Consequently, we move beyond the difference between a formal structure
and its material actualizations: since structure itself is reflexive, the non-formal
excess is inscribed into it. The problem with causal theory is that “it looks for
that x, for the feature guaranteeing the identity of a reference through all
changes of its descriptive properties, in the reality itself; this is why it must
invent its own myth, Keith Donnellan’s myth of an ‘omniscient observer of
history’ ”:
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                191


   Suppose that all that a certain speaker knows or thinks he knows about
   Thales is that he is the Greek philosopher who said that all is water. But
   suppose there never was a Greek philosopher who said such a thing.
   Suppose that Aristotle and Herodotus were referring to a well digger who
   said, “I wish all were water so I wouldn’t have to dig these damned wells.” In
   such a case, when the speaker uses the name “Thales” he is referring to that
   well digger. Furthermore, suppose there was a hermit who never had any
   dealings with anyone, who actually held that all was water. Still, when we say
   “Thales” we are plainly not referring to that hermit.23

Today, the original reference, the starting point of a causal chain—the poor
well digger—is unknown to us; but an “omniscient observer of history” capable
of following the causal chain to the act of “primal baptism” would know how to
restore the original link connecting the word “Thales” to its reference. Why is
this myth, this antidescriptivist version of the Lacanian “subject presumed to
know,” necessary? The basic problem of antidescriptivism is to determine what
constitutes the identity of the designated object beyond the ever-changing
cluster of descriptive features—what makes an object identical-to-itself even if
all its properties have changed; in other words, how to conceive the objective
correlative to the “rigid designator,” to the name in so far as it denotes the same
object in all possible worlds, in all counterfactual situations. What is overlooked,
at least in the standard version of antidescriptivism, is that this guaranteeing
the identity of an object in all counterfactual situations—through a change of
all its descriptive features—is the retroactive effect of naming itself: it is the
name itself, the signifier, which supports the identity of the object. That
“surplus” in the object which stays the same in all possible worlds is “something
in it more than itself, that is to say the Lacanian objet petit a: we search in vain
for it in positive reality because it has no positive consistency—it is just an
objectification of a void, of a discontinuity opened in reality by the emergence
of the signifier.”24
   Description and original baptism are thus not external to each other since
there is also a way in which original baptism falls into the domain of description:
original description names the dimension in the designated object which
remains unknown to the speaker, the x in the object which eludes description,
192                             Quantum History


which cannot be reduced to known properties. One can also say that original
baptism stands for the dimension of question in every description. Recall a
hilarious joke in one of the early Marx brothers movies, the “Why a duck?”
scene: Groucho say to Chico that they have to meet someone at a viaduct, and
Chico asks “Why a duck?”; when Groucho explains to him that a viaduct is a
large bridge across a valley, Chico persists: “Why a duck?” Groucho goes on
explaining: “You know, a bridge! Under the bridge, there is a green meadow . . .”
“Why a duck?” repeats Chico. So the exchange goes on: “In the midst of this
meadow, there is a pond.” “In the pond, there are some ducks swimming . . .”
“So, that’s why a duck!” triumphantly exclaims Chico, getting it right for the
wrong reason, as is often the case in ideological legitimization. Following a
wild etymology, the designation of a name is here explained through the literal
meaning of its parts: Why a duck? Because there are ducks swimming in the
pond beneath it . . .
   The key feature here is that the question (about why this name) is inscribed
into the name itself. As we all know, the word “kangaroo” originated in a similar
misunderstanding: when the first white explorers of Australia pointed at a
nearby kangaroo and asked the Indigenous people what it was, the Indigenous
respondent did not get the point, so they answered with “kangaroo,” which in
their language meant “What do you want?”. If, then, this misperception of the
question as a positive term, this inability to recognize the question, is one of
the standard procedures of ideological misrecognition, then the very inanity
of the Marx brothers’ dialogue displays a critico-ideological dimension, insofar
as it reintroduces the dimension of a question in what appears as a positive
designation: “viaduct” is really “why a duck?”. Does the logic of anti-Semitism
not rely on a similar misrecognition: while “the (anti-Semitic figure of the)
Jew” appears to designate directly a certain ethnic group, it effectively just
encodes a series of questions: “Why are we exploited? Why are the old mores
falling apart?”, etc., to which “the Jewish plot” is offered the semblance of an
answer. In other words, the first gesture of the critique of anti-Semitism is to
read “the Jew” as “Why a Jew?” . . . When Christopher Hitchens tackled the
difficult question of what the North Koreans effectively think about their
“Beloved Leader” Kim Yong Il, he produced what is arguably the most succinct
definition of ideology: “mass delusion is the only thing that keeps a people
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?               193


sane.”25 And the mechanism of this delusion is precisely the obfuscation of the
question, the misreading of the question as a statement.
   The paradox is thus that the X beyond all particular properties rendered by
symbolic descriptions is not a Kantian Thing-in-itself but an effect of language
itself: speech gives birth to the unspeakable excess that allegedly escapes its
grasp. What this means is that there is no clear cut between what others see in
me and what I am in myself: I also define myself through what others see in
me. Back to anti-Semitism: what the perpetrators of anti-Semitic pogroms find
intolerable and rage-provoking, what they react to, is not the immediate reality
of Jews, but a reality+, the reality supplemented by the image/figure of the
“Jew” which circulates and has been constructed in their tradition. The catch,
of course, is that one single individual cannot distinguish in any simple way
between real Jews and their anti-Semitic image: this image overdetermines the
way I experience real Jews themselves and, furthermore, it affects the way Jews
experience themselves. From the diaspora of the Jews and the rise of anti-
Semitism, the symbolic identity of the “real” Jews themselves is marked by
anti-Semitic fantasies: the very core of their identity is defined in the terms of
the defense against anti-Semitism.
   So, back to reality+, to simplify things to the utmost, did Hitler not offer the
Germans the fantasy-frame of Nazi ideology which made them see a specific
Pokémon—“the Jew”—popping up all around and providing the clue to what
one has to fight against? And does the same not hold for all other ideological
pseudo-entities which have to be added to reality in order to make it complete
and meaningful? One can easily imagine a contemporary anti-immigrant
version of Pokemon Go where the player wanders about a German city and is
threatened by Muslim immigrant rapists or thieves lurking everywhere. So
how does our ordinary reality relate to reality+? This ordinary reality already
is reality+ since it is sustained by the symbolic order which enframes the mode
of its perception. Here intervenes the gap between reality and the Real: reality
is always-already symbolically enframed, while the Real is that which resists
symbolization.
   If quantum physics is correct, i.e., if with quantum physics we “caught god
(the creator of the simulated world in which we live) with his pants down,”
since the ontological incompleteness of reality asserted by quantum physics
194                               Quantum History


implies that god was too lazy (or unable) to program to the end the world in
which we live, is then quantum physics not the ultimate proof that we live in
a simulated world with an imperfect simulator? The only way out of this
predicament for a materialist is to accept that ontological imperfection is a
basic feature of reality itself. For Roger Penrose, quantum mechanics is not a
complete theory because it cannot account for the collapse of the wave function
which gives birth to our everyday reality—collapse is not part of quantum
universe, it is external to it. He is in principle right, but the solution he proposes
(there has to be another reality outside the QU) is not inevitable. What about
taking more seriously (and literally) the basic premise of quantum mechanics:
QU is in itself incomplete, not fully ontologically constituted, so that what
appears a problem is its own solution? This incompleteness does not imply
that there is somewhere else a more basic reality, but it does imply that
this incompleteness (or, rather, inconsistency) of the QU pushes it towards
collapse. In other words, QU is not a happy universe where waves float around
unimpeded, it is a universe traversed by a basic impossibility.
   The eventual limit of AI is to be sought at another level, at the level of its
subjectivization. A subject’s relationship to knowledge is at the beginning
always that of transference, i.e., its knowledge constitutively relates to another
subject elevated to the status of the subject-supposed-to-know, of a subject
who already possesses the knowledge I am trying to discover. This, of course,
is what happens in the psychoanalytic treatment: the analysand acts as if
the analyst already knows the meaning of their symptoms while this meaning
is effectively constructed in the course of the treatment itself, so that the
moment when the analysand can be said to really know the meaning of its
symptoms is at the same time the moment of what Lacan calls the fall of the
subject-supposed-to-know. A similar thing happens in big religious revolutions:
when Martin Luther radically transformed Christianity, he assumed that he
was just returning to its authentic origins. In intersubjective relations, this
“illusion” of presupposed knowledge is necessary: it is only through such
an illusion that actual knowledge can emerge. However, this dialectic of
transference is totally absent in Artificial Intelligence machines: they know
(register) what they know, they can learn new things, but the growth of their
knowledge does not progress through presupposing new knowledge as already
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?              195


existing in an other, which is why they have no transferential love towards any
figure of an other.
   AI can, of course, function as a subject supposed to know for us, humans:
AI machines already know how to discern our feelings, they know more
about us than ourselves. However, AI machines themselves don’t rely in their
functioning on a subject supposed to know. (Although one cannot exclude
the possibility that we, humans, will become a specific sort of subject supposed
to know on account of our very “irrationality” and inconsistency: the AI
machine controlling us may read this inconsistency as impenetrability, as
an indication of a deeper subject in ourselves which regulates our acts in a
consistent way.)
   Furthermore, one thing AI—for the time being, at least—cannot do is to
develop small daily rituals: not habits, but rituals.26 Here are some examples
from well-known persons. When Maya Angelou arrives at a motel, she always
asks for all the pictures to be removed from the walls of her room. After
finishing her writing in the early evening, Agatha Christie took a bath and ate
an apple there. Before falling asleep, Charles Dickens always pulled out his
compass to make sure that his bed is facing north. Serena Williams always
bounced the ball five times before her first serve . . . We all do similar things,
small ritualized gestures which are quite often even embarrassing. They make
life meaningful yet they have not only no pragmatic function but also no
definite meaning, so there is no need for psychoanalysis to bring out their
hidden meaning. Their meaning is purely self-referential, it resides in the effect
of meaning. Such acts presuppose a subjectivity which tries to introduce a
minimal order in its life.
   At the opposite end of such rituals is the perplexity with regard to our place
in the symbolic order which we express in curses, so the question “Can AI
think?” should thus be transformed into a question “Can AI curse/swear?”.
Could it utter a helpless, furious outcry? As Lacan repeatedly points out,
“primordial” speech acts are single exclamations, as a rule curses or vulgar
words (“Shit”, “Wow!” . . .), which play a very specific role: they are neither
statements about things and processes that are going on in reality (like “a
storm is coming from the north”), nor are they expressions of our inner
reaction to external events (fear, anger, joy . . .). At their most basic, they
196                              Quantum History


express our lack of a proper place in the symbolic order in which we dwell. We
enter the symbolic order first as its objects: we somehow grasp that others are
talking about us, that we are within the scope of their interest, but we don’t
clearly understand what they are saying, what they want from us, what they see
in us—language as a medium is a big Other, it connects us with others and it
simultaneously functions as a wall separating us from others. Or, to quote
Etienne Balibar:

   the subject can only be conceived as the failure of the law, of language. In
   language and yet more than language, the subject is a cause for which no
   signifier can account. Not because she transcends the signifier but because
   she inhabits it as limit.27

Therein resides the clear contrast between Hegel and Habermas. Habermas
(but also Hegelians like Brandom) relies on the normativity inscribed into
language itself: the moment we speak, we are obliged to act so that we respect
the factual truth of our claims, we sincerely express our intentions, etc.
Although, of course, we often do not speak like that, we thereby get involved
into pragmatic paradoxes—we violate the normativity implied by the very fact
that we are speaking. For Lacan, on the contrary, the gap that separates language
from subject is irreducible, and the normativity inscribed into language is that
of a pretence: in speaking I pretend that am sincerely telling the truth, but this
truth is the truth of a (symbolic) fiction. Lacan in this regard follows Hegel for
whom language fits the stable categories of Understanding, so that to capture
in language the vertiginous shifts of Reason we have to violate its explicit
rules—as Hegel put it, we think only in language, but to really think we have to
use language against itself.
   It is in this sense that, for Lacan (who often evokes his dog Justine), dogs
speak but they don’t really inhabit language, i.e., they are unable to subjectivize
themselves in it, to assume a stance towards others in it. They are perplexed by
human language, and they get frustrated by their inability to participate in
linguistic exchanges—as Lacan put it, dogs are neurotic, hystericized by
language, without being its subjects. So they are not simply outside language:
what they can experience is the frustration of the fact they cannot find their
place within language, that they cannot inscribe their subjective position into
                         Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?              197


it. This is why human curses and exclamations matter: they don’t simply
express our fear or anger or joy, what they express is a much more basic
frustration at the impossibility to say in clear language what we want to say, to
“find the right word”:

   If a dog could speak, would he not bellow a curse? Perhaps that’s what
   Sartre’s dog was meaning to say all along without knowing it. The true word
   lying just beyond his grasp is not the word that would unlock the universe
   of language, allowing him to fully enter into the community of speaking
   beings and thereby put an end to his obscure frustration. It is rather the
   word by which he could name his unspeakable frustration about missing
   the word, and thus release this frustration into language itself. To speak is to
   tarry with the impossibility of speaking, to give voice to and do something
   with the bewilderment, lassitude, and rage—the abject objecthood—in
   which Sartre’s dog can only helplessly languish.28

As a further illustration Schuster mentions the famous “all-fuck” investigation
scene in Wire I/4, a scene that I analyzed in detail in an old book of mine.29 In
an empty ground floor apartment where a murder took place 6 months ago,
McNulty and Bunk, witnessed by a sole silent housekeeper, try to reconstruct
how it happened, and the only word they pronounce during their work are
variations of “fuck”—they do it 38 times in a row, in so many different ways—it
comes to mean anything, from annoyed boredom to elated triumph, from pain
or disappointment or shock at the horror of a gruesome murder to pleasant
surprise, and it reaches its climax in the self-reflexive reduplication of
“Fuckin’fuck!”. To prove it, one can easily imagine the same scene in which each
“fuck” is replaced by a more “normal” phrase (“Again, just another photo!”,
“Ouch, it hurts!”, “Now I got it!”, etc.) . . . This scene works on multiple levels,
but at its most basic it is a curse in the multitude of its uses: the same word can
function in a multitude of ways precisely because this multitude is sustained by
the frustrating impossibility of clearly expressing one’s subjective stance. So this
scene does not enact a metaphoric or reflective game adding a level to the
“realist” functioning of language—on the contrary, it enacts the basic gesture of
language, that of bringing out the crack, the impossibility, on which language is
based: we use words in a language because the “true” word is missing, and this
198                               Quantum History


word is missing because I—the speaking subject—don’t have a proper place
within the symbolic space, because I am a crack in its edifice. Curses and
exclamations are words which register the lack of a proper word, a word that
would adequately represent the subject for other words, and since the subject is
a lack in the symbolic space, a curse reflectively registers this lack.
   We can—should, even—imagine an ideal analytic session in which the
analyst reenacts the scene from Wire and from time to time just interrupts the
patient’s flow of words with a curse, maybe even with a simple “Fuck!”. It is also
in this sense that the analyst is the obverse of the master. The (wrongly)
so-called “pansexualism” of Freud (“behind everything there is sex”) would
acquire in this way an unexpected meaning: yes, the analyst’s reply to everything
is “Fuck!”, but this fuck has nothing to do with sexuality, it can refer to anything
and nothing.
   For this reason I find Lacan’s claim that a dog “has a superego without an
unconscious” problematic: if Lacan elsewhere (correctly) claims that superego
is not a moral agency but the injunction to enjoy, then the human figure of
authority to which a dog submits as a faithful servant up to the point of being
willing to sacrifice itself is not a superego figure but rather a (fantasy of) the
perfect Master—a dog has neither an unconscious nor a superego. It is only
through human perversion that the obscene superego enters the game, so that
even the dog from Kafka’s story which finds (surplus-)enjoyment in fasting to
death does not do it out of a superego pressure. If “the neurotic longs for a
master that would release him from the need for a master, and allow him to
finally act on his own,”30 a dog already found such a master instead of just
looking for him.
   And let’s go to the end here: does the exclamation “Christ!” not work in a
similar way like “Fuck!”? We can easily imagine the scene from Wire with
“Christ!” instead of “Fuck!”, where the curse would express the same frustrating
inability to subjectivize our position in the big Other. In Mel Brooks’s History
of the World: Part I there is a scene in which the hero (played by Brooks
himself), a waiter in Jerusalem in the year of 33, is asked to serve at an important
dinner; when, in the middle of dinner, one of his plates slips out of his hands
and falls down, he exclaims “O, Christ!”, and gets a gentle answer from one of
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                199


the guests: “Yes, please?” What we should advocate is the move in the opposite
direction, from the actual dialogue to a pure exclamation.
   And why should we not bring the two dimensions—sex and god’s name—
together? Recall (trigger warning!) a dirty joke: in an elementary school class,
the teacher is asking boys how do we go to heaven when we are dying, and one
of them replies: “First with our legs.” Surprised, the teacher says “Why?”, and
the boy replies: “A week ago, when my father was on a business trip, I entered
my parents’ bedroom and I saw someone laying on my mother making strange
movements; my mother’s legs were raised high up and she was shouting: ‘O
Christ, I’m coming!’” This mention of Christ is not simply a blasphemy, it just
gives words to the mother’s frustrating inability to find the right word for the
intense pleasure she is experiencing. So let’s imagine that, if Kierkegaard were
to consummate his love for Regine, she would be uttering the same phrase
when approaching the orgasm. Even more, if Christ were not Christ, would he
not also be justified to utter a simple “Christ!” or “Fuck!” instead of the well-
known “Father, why have you abandoned me?” when dying on the cross?
ONLY in Christianity can we imagine such an outcry.
   This dimension of uneasiness/discontent in language is the topic that lies
beneath Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus—he tries to resolve it by way of
clearly distinguishing what we can speak about and what we cannot speak
about—or, as he writes in the final proposition of Tractatus: Wovon man nicht
sprechen kann, darueber muss man schweigen. (Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must be silent.)31 The immediate question this raises is why should
one prohibit something that is already in itself impossible? The answer is
relatively easy: if we ignore this prohibition, we produce statements which are
(for Wittgenstein) meaningless, like speculations about the noumenal domain
in Kant’s philosophy. (Lacan qualified the prohibition of incest in a similar way,
claiming that its function is to render the impossible possible: if incest has to
be prohibited, it means that it is possible if we violate this prohibition.) We find
also a theological version of this prohibition in The Day Of Doom, Michael
Wigglesworth’s poem published in 1662, a dark Puritan description of the
punishment of sinners which was for a century the absolute bestseller in the
American colonies. When, on the Judgment Day, individuals confront God
200                               Quantum History


the Judge, the sight is too strong to be put in words, “therefore I must pass it by,
lest speaking should transgress.”32
   There is, however, an ambiguity in Wittgenstein’s proposition which resides
in the double meaning of “kann”: it can mean simple ontic impossibility, or a
deontic prohibition (“you cannot talk/behave like that!”). Wittgenstein’s
proposition can thus be read in a radical ontological sense intended by
Wittgenstein himself—there are things impossible to talk about like
metaphysical speculations—, or in a conformist-deontic sense—“Shut up
about things you are not allowed to talk about!” The opposite of this conformist
wisdom is the ethical imperative: Wovon man nicht schweigen kann, darueber
muss man sprechen. (Whereof one cannot be silent, thereof one must speak.)
Horrors like the Holocaust or Communist purges or colonial disasters cannot
be passed over in silence (as happens in today’s China), we have to bring
them out.
   The opposite of this ethical injunction is a tautological cynical wisdom:
Wovon man nicht schweigen kann, darueber muss man schweigen. (Whereof
one cannot be silent, thereof one must be silent.) Which means: even if you
know you cannot keep quiet about it, do not talk about it since talking about it
would pose too much of a threat to you.—What, then, about the opposite
tautology: Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darueber muss man sprechen.
(Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one should speak.) It defines poetry:
poetry is an attempt to put in words what cannot be said, to evoke it, and this
holds precisely for traumatic events like the Holocaust: any prosaic description
of the horrors of the Holocaust fails to render its trauma, and this is why
Adorno was wrong with his famous claim that after Auschwitz poetry is no
longer possible: it is prose which is no longer possible, since only poetry can do
the job. Poetry is the inscription of impossibility into a language: when we
cannot say something directly and we nonetheless insist on doing so, we
unavoidably get caught in repetitions, postponements, indirectness, surprising
cuts, etc. We should always bear in mind that the “beauty” of classic poetry
(symmetric rhymes, etc.) comes second, that it is a way to compensate for the
basic failure or impossibility.
   But this is not Wittgenstein’s last word: already in Tractatus, he introduces
another term which works as the opposite of saying (Sprechen), namely
                       Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?                 201


showing/displaying (Zeigen), so we can also say: Wovon man nicht sprechen
kann, das zeigt sich. (Whereof one cannot speak, that shows itself.) The
inversion of this statement (Was man nicht zeigen kann, darueber muss man
sprechen.—“What one cannot show, thereof one must speak.”) is a vulgar
commonsense notion since it reduces “showing” to the obvious meaning of
“what is evidently present in front of us,” which can be exemplified by seeing
one’s exterior; the argument is then that focusing on how a person appears
ignores the deeper spiritual truth of this person, the truth which can only be
rendered by words describing this truth.
   Against this line of argumentation one should focus on the elementary
Hegelian question: not what is the secret beneath appearance but why does a
thing need to appear in the first place. In short, Wittgenstein’s “showing” has
nothing to do with “appearing” as opposed to what is beneath it. “Showing” is
the form of appearance ignored when we focus on what appears—Wittgenstein
follows here Marx and Freud who both claim that the true secret is not what is
Beyond what appears but the form itself (the commodity form, the form of
dreams). The difference between zeigen (showing) and schweigen (keeping
silent) is that while schweigen is an act (I decide not to speak, which implies
that I am already within the domain of speech—a stone does not “keep silent”),
zeigen happens involuntarily, it is a by-product of what I am doing when I
speak: I don’t (and cannot) decide what to show.
   This insight (formulated by Wittgenstein in many versions, like “what can
be shown cannot be said”) should not be read as a hint towards some ineffable
deep Truth beyond words: what cannot be said is fully immanent to saying, it
is the form displayed by saying, it is what we do by saying something. To
Wittgenstein’s example of “honesty” we could add “dignity”: if you talk about
it, you are NOT dignified or honest—honesty and dignity can only be shown/
displayed by doing it, by acting as an honest or dignified person. Recall what I
often referred to as the “Hugh-Grant-paradox” (referring to the famous scene
from Four Weddings And a Funeral): the hero tries to articulate his love to the
beloved, he gets caught in stumbling and confused repetitions, and it is this
very failure to deliver his message of love in a perfect way that bears witness to
its authenticity . . . In his very failure to speak about his love, he shows/displays
it (although we can, of course, also intentionally fake such failures). We are
202                              Quantum History


dealing here with Wittgenstein’s version of “there is no meta-language”: a
speech act cannot include into what it says its own form, its own act. Jon Elster
articulated this feature in his notion of “states that are essentially by-products”:

   Some psychological and social states have the property that they can only
   come about as the by-product of actions undertaken for other ends. They
   can never, that is, be brought about intelligently and intentionally, because
   they attempt to do so precludes the very state one is trying to bring about. I
   call these “states that are essentially by-products.” There are many states that
   may arise as by-products of individual or aggregate action, but this is the
   subset of states than can only come about in this way. Some of these states
   are very useful or desirable, and so it is very tempting to try to bring them
   about. We may refer to such attempts as “excess of will,” a form of hubris that
   pervades our lives, perhaps increasingly so.33

Among many examples offered by Elster (like “Good art is impressive; art
designed to impress rarely is”34), one should mention the topic of authenticity
and sincerity:

   The terms of sincerity and authenticity, like those of wisdom and dignity,
   always have a faintly ridiculous air about them when employed in the first
   person singular, reflecting the fact that the corresponding states are
   essentially by-products. . . . Naming the unnamable by talking about
   something else is an ascetic practice and goes badly with self-congratulation.35

Elster mentions here the “unnamable,” which brings us back to Wittgenstein:
sincerity and authenticity cannot be named, they can only be shown/displayed
by way of practicing it—a lesson that deals a heavy blow to the cult of
authenticity which pervades our culture from the 1950s onwards. And a similar
logic holds also for worshipping a god: “To paraphrase [Stanislav] Lem’s
personoid Adan 900: Any god that demands our worship doesn’t deserve it.”36
   Following Bertrand Russell’s famous quip about Wittgenstein (who,
according to Russell, managed to say quite a lot about the unsayable37), could
we not say that Elster also manages to say quite a lot about the dimension that
he proclaims “unnamable”? However, this reproach misses the point. Of course
we can talk about what a speech shows/displays, but not in the first person:
                      Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?               203


I cannot designate myself as authentic, as having dignity, etc.—if I do this, I
undermine my authenticity or dignity which can only show itself in how I act.
The statement “there is no meta-language” should be understood in this precise
sense: I cannot include my position of enunciation (which may display dignity)
into my own enunciated content. And this brings us to Robert Pippin’s
interpretation of Hegel, to his move from Hegel to Heidegger. For Pippin,
Hegel remains at the level of saying, there is nothing really impossible to say
(to articulate in predicative judgments), while what Heidegger refers to as
“being-in-the-world” points towards the pre-predicative dimension of
showing/displaying.
   And does something similar not hold for both poles of today’s global
political space, authoritarian nationalism and Cancel Culture? On September
29, 2023, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov “has indicated that Moscow
is prepared for discussions concerning Ukraine, provided they take into
account the situation on the ground and Russia’s security interests.”38 Which
means: we are prepared for peace negotiations provided Ukraine accepts that
territories occupied by Russia are part of Russia, and provided it radically
changes its politics (Russia demands “de-Nazification” of Ukraine) . . . in short,
provided Ukraine capitulates. The Western liberal approach is often
problematized along the same lines by anti-colonial critics: for the Western
liberals, democratic exchange is formulated in terms which secretly impose the
logic of Western democracy-and-freedom, so that joining liberal pluralism
effectively amounts to a capitulation to Western values . . . Lavrov asserts the
logic problematized by anti-colonial critics in its pure form. In Wittgensteinian
terms, Lavrov speaks about negotiations, but what he shows/displays with his
speech is the very opposite of negotiation, a brutal exclusive enforcing of one’s
own position.
   Along the same lines, I can easily imagine Hegel having a repeated intellectual
orgasm in bringing out the (for him) obvious necessity of the reversal of
inclusivity and diversity into a procedure of systematic exclusion: “How long
can parts of the liberal Left keep maintaining that ‘cancel culture’ is but a
phantom of the right, as they literally go round canceling gigs, comedy shows,
film showings, lectures and conversations?”39 What permeates “cancel culture”
is a “no-debate-stance”: a person or position is not only excluded—what is
204                               Quantum History


excluded is the very debate, the confrontation of arguments, for or against this
exclusion. Hegel would have mobilized here what Lacan called the gap between
enunciated content and the underlying stance of enunciation: you argue for
diversity and inclusion, but you do it by excluding all those who do not fully
subscribe to your own definition of diversity and inclusion—so all you do is
permanently exclude people and stances. In this way the struggle for inclusion
and diversity gives birth to an atmosphere of Stasi-like suspicion and
denunciation where you never know when a private remark of yours will lead
to your elimination from the public space . . . Don’t we get here an extreme
version of the joke about eating the last cannibal? “There are no opponents of
diversity and inclusion in our group—we’ve just excluded the last one . . .” So,
again, in Wittgensteinian terms, while Cancel Culture speaks about diversity
and inclusion, it shows/displays a stance of extreme exclusion.
   Such inversion of inclusion into exclusion also obeys a deep Hegelian
dialectical reversal, namely the transposition of an external threat into
immanent antagonism, as it was perspicuously noted by Elster apropos the
notion, fashionable today, of democracy under threat: “We can reverse the
common dictum that democracy is under threat, and affirm that democracy is
the threat, at least in its short-termist populist form.”40 Exactly as in the case of
Cancel Culture, the threat to inclusion and diversity are inclusion and diversity
themselves, when they are practiced in a way that shows/displays extreme
exclusion.
   And should we not add two further variations where “sprechen” is replaced by
“schweigen”? “Wovon man nicht schweigen kann, das zeigt sich,” and “wovon man
schweigen soll, das zeigt sich”? They follow the logic of a symptom which takes
place at the level of “zeigen”: a symptom is not simply a statement—in it, what is
forbidden/impossible to say displays itself. What is then the difference between
the two versions, between “nicht schweigen kann” and “schweigen soll”? Is it not
again the difference between ethical prohibition and ontological impossibility?
What one “cannot be silent about” points towards the ontological insistence of a
drive which, even if it is not articulated in full propositions, shows itself, while
what “one must be silent about” indicates an ethical prohibition.
   All these variations on Wittgenstein’s final thesis are thus superpositions
which express in various modes the subject’s frustration at the basic deadlock
                          Can Artificial Intelligence Really Think?             205


of our symbolic existence, and, as we have already seen, the ultimate expression
of this frustration is the act of swearing. The ultimate variation on Wittgenstein’s
final thesis is thus: “Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, das muss man verfluchen.”
What we cannot speak about, we should swear at.
   Magnus Carlsen, the de facto world champion bored by classic chess (he
mostly ignores big tournaments for the last two years), now joined the ranks of
those who promote freestyle chess where the pieces on the back rank are
randomized in the starting position. I see in this tendency to move to freestyle
chess a reaction to the fact that in classic chess computers set the standard and
regularly beat top human players (the latter’s quality is measured by how close
they come to the way a computer would play). When the back rank pieces are
randomized, the number of possible moves grows exponentially, so that for
some time at least computers will lose their advantage. Another way for
humans to gain advantage even in classic chess is that, while knowing perfectly
how their digital opponent will play, they intentionally make moves which are
“wrong” (less than optimal), counting on the fact that their “wrong” moves will
perplex the digital machine which will try to read a deeper intentional strategy
into their “wrong” moves and thus make moves which will no longer obey the
optimal strategy. However, such a perplexed state means that the digital
machine will react to our “irrational” moves with something like a curse—but
they cannot curse . . .
   Could we not say something similar about the well-known “prisoner’s
dilemma,” a thought experiment involving two rational agents each of whom
can either cooperate for mutual benefit or betray their partner (“defect”) for
individual gain? While defecting is rational for each agent, cooperation yields
a higher payoff for each. The paradox involved here has often been noted, and
it concerns, as expected, self-reflexivity: if (in a situation with multiple
participants) I can reasonably assume that other participants will choose trust
and cooperation, then I can immensely profit by not choosing trust but by
defecting.
   In other words, we cannot truly communicate with AI—so what would
have been a perfect communication? One shouldn’t be surprised that we find
it at the lowest of the lowest of popular culture: in one of the sub-plots of Love,
Actually (Richard Curtis, 2023), writer Jamie withdraws from London to his
206                              Quantum History


French cottage, where he meets a Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia who does
not speak English (and he, of course, doesn’t speak Portugese). Precisely
because the two don’t share a common language, a mutual attraction grows:
they talk a lot, but counting on the fact that the other will not understand what
one is saying, they are more and more making open love declarations to each
other—and although they don’t understand each other’s words, they
understand all the more fully the intended emotional impact. No wonder that,
at the end, they get happily married . . .

     The politics of vocation


If the present book deserves to be dedicated to anyone, it is to the people of
Tristan da Cunha, the 98-square kilometers island in the middle of nowhere in
the South Atlantic, lying approximately 2,787 kilometers (1,732 miles) from
Cape Town and 2,437 kilometers (1,514 miles) from the nearest inhabited place,
the island of Saint Helena. On October 10, 1961, a volcanic eruption forced the
evacuation of all 264 people to the UK, but in 1963 almost all of them returned,
withstanding the temptation of developed capitalism—why? Was it because the
island has a unique social and economic structure based on solidarity, not
competition? All resident families farm and all land is communally owned . . . in
short, it is a Communist island. So much more than Bhutan with its ridiculous
“dictatorship of happiness,”1 Tristan da Cunha should serve as a model to all of
us. Bhutan measures happiness by periodically surveying about 10 percent of
the population and compiling statistics that fall under nine domains: living
standards, health, education, environment, community, time-use, psychological
well-being, governance, and culture—it is easy to imagine how this very
bureaucratic procedure of measuring happiness undermines its goal.2
   But what can this small island in the middle of nowhere tell us about our
predicament? It enables us to look for the traces of similar solidarity that still
abound all around us, although we are conditioned to ignore them like the good
old Pavlov’s dog. There is a notion (with a religious background, but nonetheless
open to a materialist reading) which shows a way to make one’s life meaningful
without falling into a trap of some higher power guaranteeing this meaning,
that of vocation. In his Shattered, Hanif Kureishi notes that, much more than top
specialist doctors, nurses are those who consider their job a vocation:

                                                                              207
208                               Quantum History


   From the conversations I’ve had with the nurses, with whom I spend
   most of my days, and some of my nights—not having known any before—
   they consider their work to be a vocation, a calling, a whole way of life.
   They dress and undress me, wash my body, genitals, and arse, cleaning
   everything. They brush my hair, change my dressings, feed and engage me
   in conversations; insert suppositories, change my catheter and brush my
   teeth, shave and transfer me from bed to chair—this is their everyday work.
   . . . The nurses here are cheerful, they sing and make jokes, but they are not
   well paid. Wages are certainly lower in Italy than they are in the UK but they
   have been doing this for years and, as far as I can tell, want to carry on.3

We are not talking here about some higher form of creativity (art, politics,
science . . .) which passionately occupies us, although this is also the opposite
of a job we are doing just for money. We are talking about hard unpleasant
work which brings little remuneration—we do it because we feel that we
simply cannot not do it. Kureishi is perspicuous enough to immediately add
that vocation and sexuality are not to be opposed—they can be in competition
because they are both a vocation. Note also the profoundly theological
Deleuzian remark that, in an authentic vocation, I don’t choose it but I am
chosen by it: “There is also a sexual aspect to the notion of vocation, since such
a choice, like sexuality, isn’t an option, but something you are inexorably drawn
to. It chooses you, rather than the other way round.”4 So I don’t impute to the
inhabitants of Tristan a special pleasure in their way of life, I don’t in any sense
“feel their pleasure” in what is undoubtedly their rather harsh life. The great
Scottish runner Eric Liddell (who won the 400 meters race at the 1924
Olympics in Paris) said: “I believe God made me for a purpose, but He also
made me fast. And when I run, I feel His pleasure.” From my perspective, such
a claim comes too close to perversion, and what pops up in my mind is a
variation on Niels Bohr’s answer to Einstein’s famous “God doesn’t play dice”:
“Don’t tell god when to feel pleasure!” I am only claiming that for the inhabitants
of Tristan their life there is their vocation.
   Plus my claim in no way implies that human nature (if we risk this term,
whatever it could mean) is basically good and only corrupted in societies in
which exploitation reigns. What I only claim is that the idea of human nature as
                               The Politics of Vocation                         209


basically egotist and utilitarian is wrong, regularly violated in both directions—
or, as Freud puts it in “The Ego and the Id”: “If anyone were to put forward the
paradoxical proposition that normal man is not only far more immoral than he
believes but also far more moral than he knows, psycho-analysis, on whose
findings the first half of the assertion rests, would have no objection to raise
against the second half.”5 The core of what we refer to as “evil” is not egotism but
envy and resentment which make me act against my rational interests since the
other’s displeasure matters to me more than my own pleasure.
   We should take this parallel to its logical conclusion: if I fall passionately in
love with a woman (or the other way round) and she is indifferent towards me
or even finds me disgusting, love was still not my own free choice—my
experience is that I was chosen to love her. But what if a vocation is a fake, not
only in the obvious sense that there are vocations for an evil cause (Nazis,
Stalinists, and today’s religious fundamentalists also experience their terror as
a vocation), but in a more refined sense: when I am effectively caught into the
capitalist machinery, working for profit, it can make me even more efficient if
I experience myself as pursuing a vocation (developing new products or
whatsoever)?6 Here one should shamelessly insist on the difference between an
authentic vocation and a fake one, a difference which can be deployed through
an immanent analysis: the vocation for an evil cause has to rely on an obscene
underground of obscene enjoyment, and the vocation as a mask of capitalist
activity also has to obfuscate its ultimate meaninglessness.
   There is a recent film which focuses precisely on vocation as a way to escape
the capitalist commodification of our life, also in the form of dedicating it to
some higher spiritual pursuit (a form which is still confined to the fulfilment
of our ego): Krzysztof Zanussi’s late masterpiece Liczba doskonała (The Perfect
Number, 2022). A young Polish mathematician-physicist is immersed in his
scientific research and in the teaching of his subjects, while his elderly Jewish-
Polish cousin from Jerusalem would like to donate him the wealth accumulated
during his life as a businessman. The young mathematician rejects this offer,
since he wants to remain poor but happy in his life of teaching and researcher
of Physics—he knows his vocation is the elaboration of the space-time theories
of Quantum Physics . . . simple as it may sound, this solution actually works. It
provides a new version of the old and often misused formula of freedom as a
210                                Quantum History


recognized necessity: the necessity I recognize is my vocation. To see this, one
has to be caught in it—only in this way we can leave behind the cynical distance
that predominates today.
   However, Zanussi complicates things here, he presents the two positions—
the rich Jewish businessman and the young poor scientist dedicated to his
vocation—as two parallel stances echoing each other: both are focused on
their own life achievement, both exclude any intense relationship with others,
i.e., in both cases, there is no space for a loving “we.” At the film’s end, the uncle’s
death sobers the scientist, he shows compassion for others and responds to the
love of a woman who was faithfully waiting for him till he became able to act
as part of a loving “we.”
   I am skeptical towards this stance because I think that love or compassionate
social engagement (like that of Kureishi’s nurses) are also forms of vocation.
Zanussi’s scientist is not a truly consistent figure, he combines authentic
vocation with pathological features which are not an immanent part of one’s
vocation (one should recall that he is extremely ambitious, he wants to be
remembered in history for his discoveries). There is no immanent contradiction
between pursuing science as a vocation and engaging in a loving relationship
or fighting for social justice. Even if the two appear to enter into a conflict
(“does your scientific or political vocation not make you neglect our love?”),
we should reject the very terms of this choice: in an authentic dilemma, one
should not decide between Cause and love, between the fidelity to one or
the other event. The authentic relationship between Cause and love is more
paradoxical.
   The basic lesson of King Vidor’s Rhapsody is that, in order to gain the
beloved woman’s love, the man has to prove that he is able to survive without
her, that he prefers his mission or profession to her. There are two immediate
choices: (1) my professional career is what matters most to me, the woman is
just an amusement, a distracting affair; (2) the woman is everything to me, I
am ready to humiliate myself, to forsake all my public and professional dignity
for her. They are both false, they lead to the man being rejected by the woman.
The message of true love is thus: even if you are everything to me, I can survive
without you, I am ready to forsake you for my mission or profession. The
proper way for the woman to test the man’s love is thus to betray him at the
                              The Politics of Vocation                        211


crucial moment of his career (the first public concert in the film, the key exam,
the business negotiation which will decide his career)—only if he can survive
the ordeal and accomplish successfully his task although deeply traumatized
by her desertion, will he deserve her and she will return to him.
   The underlying paradox is that love, precisely as the Absolute, should not be
posited as a direct goal—it should retain the status of a by-product, of something
we get as an undeserved grace. Perhaps, there is no greater love than that of a
revolutionary couple, where each of the two lovers is ready to abandon the
other at any moment if revolution demands it. The question is thus: how does
an emancipatory-revolutionary collective which embodies the “general will”
affect intense erotic passion? From what we know about love among the
Bolshevik revolutionaries, something unique took place there, a new form of
the romantic couple emerged: a couple living in a permanent emergency state,
totally dedicated to the revolutionary Cause, ready to sacrifice all personal
sexual fulfilment to it, even ready to abandon and betray each other if Revolution
demanded it, but simultaneously totally dedicated to each other, enjoying rare
moments together with extreme intensity. The lovers’ passion was tolerated,
even silently respected, but ignored in the public discourse as something of no
concern to others. (There are traces of this even in what we know of Lenin’s
affair with Inessa Armand.) There is no attempt at Gleichschaltung, at enforcing
the unity between intimate passion and social life: the radical disjunction
between sexual passion and social-revolutionary activity is fully recognized.
The two dimensions are accepted as totally heterogeneous, each irreducible to
the other, there is no harmony between the two—but it is this very recognition
of the gap which makes their relationship non-antagonistic.
   How, then, does vocation stand with regard to belief? Remember the
denouement of le Carré’s The Little Drummer Girl when Khalil, the Palestinian
fighter, a sincere “terrorist,” discovers that the English actress Charlie who
pretended to join his cause and even voluntarily became his lover betrayed him:

   “Who do you work for, Charlie? For the Germans?” She shook her head.
   “For the Zionists?” He took her silence for yes. “Are you Jewish.” “No.” “Do
   you believe in Israel? What are you?”“Nothing,” she said. “Are you Christian?
   Do you see them as the founders of your great religion?” Again she shook
212                              Quantum History


   her head. “Is it for money? Did they bribe you? Blackmail you?” She wanted
   to scream. She clenched her fists, and filled her lungs, but the chaos choked
   her, and she sobbed instead. . . . Slowly, without aggression, he reached out
   his left hand and touched the side of her face, apparently to make sure that
   she was real. Then looked at the tips of his fingers, and back at her again,
   somehow comparing them in his mind.7

In both the movie and in the BBC miniseries version, they inserted another
line by Khalil at . . . : “So you don’t believe in anything.”(the miniseries) / “You
believe in nothing. You have no beliefs at all.”(the movie) Although the movie
and TV versions are not to be underestimated (in the TV miniseries, Florence
Pugh is excellent as Charlie, while in the movie Juliano Mer-Khamis totally
steals the show as Khalil), the inserted line is basically superfluous, it just
renders explicit what is obvious from the scene itself: Khalil’s properly ethical
disappointment at Charlie. When he asks Charlie if she did it because she
believes in Israel or Christianity, or because she was blackmailed, this is not an
accusation but an attempt to find acceptable reasons for her betrayal. When he
realizes that Charlie believes in nothing, his reaction is not violence but just a
sad total resignation mixed with a minimum of compassion. The worst mistake
would have been here to dismiss such a full commitment as something that
necessarily leads to religious fundamentalism: to make life worth living, a
human being should act as more than a human animal following its needs and
interests—a full commitment to a Cause is needed. True, Blaise Pascal was
right when he wrote: “Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when
they do it from religious conviction.” However, what distinguishes such
commitment from religious fundamentalism is that it is fully aware of its
subjective character, which is why it always functions against the background
of a possible loss of belief enacted, among other cases, in Christ’s “Father, why
have you forsaken me?”. What remains for a Christian in such cases is only the
unconditional love for those who are bent for self-destruction.
   Following Padre Raffaele Nogaro’s groundbreaking idea of the urgent need
to liberate Christ himself,8 we should accept that Christ works as a vanishing
mediator in every authentic love—he is here whenever there is love between
humans: “For where two or three gather in my name, there I am with
                               The Politics of Vocation                         213


them.”(Matthew 18:20) Christ is thus neither the subject nor the object of love,
he is love itself: “Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is
love.”(John 4:8) Padre Nogaro makes this point with full clarity: “Jesus
substitutes the first commandment of the old Law ‘love your master God’ (Dt
6:5) with the commandment which does not have as its direct addressee God
but the neighbour.” Nogaro then quotes Dietrich Bonhoffer who takes this to
its logical extreme: “A Christian is not a religious man but simply a man,
a ‘being for others’ like Jesus.” This is also why the genuine dimension of
Christian doubt does not concern the existence of god: its logic is not “I feel
such a need to believe in god, but I cannot be sure that he really exists, that he
is not just a chimera of my imagination.” (A humanist atheist can easily respond
to this: “then drop god and simply assume the ideals god stands for as your
own.”) An authentic Christian is indifferent towards the infamous proofs of
god’s existence. What the position of Christian doubt involves is a pragmatic
paradox succinctly rendered by Alyosha in Dostoyevsky’s Karamazov Brothers:
“God exists but I am not sure whether I believe in him,” where “I believe in
him” refers to the believer’s readiness to fully assume the existential engagement
implied by such a belief: “the question of the ‘existence of God’ is not really at
the heart of Dostoyevsky’s labors. . . . Alyosha’s uncertainty about whether he
‘believes in God’ is an uncertainty about whether the life he leads and the
feelings he has are the life and the feelings that would rightly follow from belief
in God.”9 It is in this sense that every theology is political: it confronts us with
the question of our social engagement. That’s why I fully endorse Nogaro’s
motto: “WITH JESUS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BELIEVE, TO LOVE IS
ENOUGH.” In other words, the same holds for belief as for love: belief is not
belief in god (as an object external to us), Jesus is here in our belief itself (our
full commitment to a worthy Cause).
                                   *
More precisely, we should introduce here a gap between belief and faith:
what Khalil talks about is faith, not belief, and fundamentalists reduce faith to
belief. Mark Murphy determines this gap, paraphrasing Lacan’s thesis that
“desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction nor the demand for love, but the
difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second, the
very phenomenon of their splitting”10: “The question of mere ‘questions of
214                             Quantum History


belief ’ and knowledge of God—and the vulgar framework that entails—is
negated when we encounter faith by subtracting one from the other: faith
appears as a negative surplus when knowledge is subtracted from belief.”11 This
is why one can say “I believe Hitler (when he says he wants to eliminate Jews),
but I don’t have faith in him”. Belief is a belief in facts beyond what we know
(say, I believe there is an alien civilization on Mars), faith is a subjective
engagement.
  The paradox of authentic faith is that, although it excludes fundamentalism,
it also excludes its apparent opposite, cultural relativization. For years, the
populist Right were targeting “cultural Marxism” as an allegedly new and even
more dangerous form of Marxism bent on destroying the very basis of our
civilization. The idea is that, after the failure of the revolutions in the West
around the early 1920s, Communists realized that the cause of this failure was
the strength of traditional religious values, so they changed their target and
concentrated on first undermining the cultural values that sustain our
civilization. The combination of Marxism with psychoanalysis supposedly
proved ideal for this task . . . The irony is that today the newly emerging
orthodox Communist Left also uses this term, but from the opposite standpoint:
Western Marxism which replaced political revolutionary struggle with cultural
analysis, neglecting or even condemning actual Communist states, was from
the beginning a tool of imperialism to neutralize Marxism, to make it
acceptable for the capitalist academia with no links to actual working class
movements. The old saying “when nothing goes right, go left” holds true today
more than ever—and it is also more difficult to follow than ever.


But history is full of surprises—now this term has its atheist counterpart:
cultural Christianity—here is a recent case of such culturalization. On August
28, 2024, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, with the assent of Pope
Francis, rendered public a Note which granted approval for devotion linked to
Medjugorje, recognizing the abundant spiritual fruits received at the Sanctuary
of the Queen of Peace. Without making a declaration on the supernatural
character of the Marian apparitions, it just recognizes the goodness of the
spiritual fruits linked to Medjugorje, authorizing the faithful to adhere to it
since “many positive fruits have been noted in the midst of a spiritual
                              The Politics of Vocation                         215


experience, while negative and dangerous effects have not spread among the
People of God.”12
   The last sentence is weird: it sounds as if it admits there were also negative
and dangerous effects which just have not spread around as much as the good
ones—so it’s not a question of truth but of a cold calculation of good effects
versus bad effects: since the good effects dominate, let’s tolerate the pilgrimage.
The phrase nihil obstat was used by a Catholic cleric known as a Censor
Librorum (Latin for ‘censor of books’) to indicate that a book contains nothing
contrary to Catholic doctrines, faith, or morals, and so can be published. The
message of the Note was also a nihil obstat: even if there are serious doubts
about the miraculous nature of the appearances of Mary, the Note poses no
obstacle to the Catholics who want to continue to make pilgrimages to
Medjugorje. Are the authors of the Note aware that they are reasoning like the
big figures of the Enlightenment like Voltaire who were in private atheists or at
least agnostic sceptics: they thought that, even if religion was not based on
truth, ordinary people needed it since they were too weak to listen to reason—
only a figure of supernatural authority could compel them to control their
destructive and immoral passions . . .
   After the Khomeini revolution in Iran, the first censor installed by the
regime to review all new movies and decide whether they should be shown or
not was a blind cleric, so when he was watching a movie someone was sitting
at his side and describing to him what was happening on the screen—maybe,
this is an ideal censor because the true censor’s job is not to judge the work
itself but the effect this work produces in an average viewer. And did the
Dicastery not act in a similar way? What matters is not the immanent truth but
its effects . . .
                                        *
Lately even some ferocious atheists (like Richard Dawkins) declared themselves
“cultural Christians”: although they don’t believe in god, they respect and
practice the moral rules of Christianity, considering them superior with regard
to all other religions. With the Note on Medjugorje, it seems that even the
Vatican itself made a turn in this direction: what matters more than truth are
the ethical implications of a religious stance. Such postmodern pragmatic
relativism is as far as one can imagine from the authentic belief of someone
216                             Quantum History


like Kierkegaard who was in no way a dogmatic fundamentalist—he famously
proclaimed that we cannot ever be fully sure that we believe, we can only
believe that we believe and thus accept the absurdity of belief. In Murder in the
Cathedral, T.S. Eliot has his de facto mouthpiece Thomas Beckett say: “The last
temptation is the greatest treason / To do the right thing for the wrong reason.”
The authentic Kierkegaardian lesson is that we should turn this claim around:
no, the highest form of treason is to do the right thing for the right reason—
when we think we are doing this, we adopt the arrogant position of a subject
who, in full self-transparency, knows what he is doing. But we never know this
since we shouldn’t trust even our most sincere beliefs—as Kierkegaard put it,
we can only believe that we believe.
   Cultural Christians are totally blind to the desperate inner turmoil
Kierkegaard went through, the turmoil that is condensed in the story about the
Fall. The serpent says that by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Adam
and Eve will become like God; and after the two do it, God comments: “Behold,
Adam has become like one of us.”(Genesis 3:22) Hegel’s comment is: “So the
serpent did not lie, for God confirms what it said.” Then Hegel goes on to reject
the claim that what God says is meant with irony: “Cognition is the principle
of spirituality, and this . . . is also the principle by which the injury of the
separation is healed.”13 Hegel announces here the final message of Richard
Wagner’s Parsifal: “The wound can be healed only by the spear that smote it
(Die Wunde schliesst der Speer nur der Sie schlug).” Subjective freedom is not
just the possibility to choose evil or good,

   it is the consideration or the cognition that makes people evil, so
   that consideration and cognition themselves are what is evil, and that
   therefore such cognition is what ought not to exist because it is the source
   of evil.14

The Good emerges as a possibility and duty only through this primordial/
constitutive choice of Evil: we experience the Good when, after choosing Evil,
we become aware of the utter inadequacy of our situation. The queerness of
the Law thus reaches its apogee in Christianity in which we, humans, are a
priori presumed to be fallen, to dwell in sin, so that the entire reign of the law
consists of the rules of how to deal with our violations of the law: through
                              The Politics of Vocation                         217


confessions and other modes of ritualized repentance. That’s why, as many
perspicuous theologians knew, the Fall is felix culpa, the fortunate fault/the
blessed fall—or, as St. Augustine put it: “For God judged it better to bring good
out of evil than not to permit any evil to exist.” We have to add another step to
this reasoning: in order to bring good out of evil, the Good itself—God—has
to bring evil out of itself. This is why we should turn around the standard
Christian (or Catholic, more precisely) explanation of why there is evil in the
world: god gave us freedom, and freedom is the freedom to choose what we
freely decide, inclusive of evil . . . But is it not the other way round? God (more
than just exposed us to the temptation of evil, he) pushed us into evil so that we
would discover our freedom. There is no freedom without evil since to be able
to choose between good and evil one already has to be in evil. No wonder that
back in 2017 even Pope Francis, who usually displayed the right intuitions in
matters theological and political, committed a serious blunder in endorsing
the idea, propagated by some Catholics, to change a line in Lord’s Prayer where
it asks “lead us not into temptation”:

   It is not a good translation because it speaks of a God who induces
   temptation. I am the one who falls; it’s not him pushing me into temptation
   to then see how I have fallen. A father doesn’t do that, a father helps you to
   get up immediately. It’s Satan who leads us into temptation, that’s his
   department.15

The first thing to note here is that there could be more truth in what is clearly
a mistranslation than in a more faithful rendering of the original meaning.
There are good reasons to accept that the Christian topic of immaculate
conception is grounded in the mistranslation of the Hebrew alma (which
simply means “young woman”) as “virgin”: “It would appear that Western
civilization has endured two millennia of consecrated sexual neurosis simply
because the authors of Matthew and Luke could not read Hebrew.”16 There are
also good reasons to accept that the seventy “virgins” awaiting martyrs in the
Muslim paradise resulted from a mistranslation: in using the word hur,
transliterated as “houris,” Koran relied here on the early Christian texts which
used the Aramaic hur, meaning “white raisins,” a delicacy. Let us take a young
martyr on a suicide mission because he took literally his leader’s promise: “The
218                               Quantum History


gates of Paradise have opened for you. There are beautiful black-eyed virgins
waiting for you on the banks of rivers of honey.” Imagine the look on his face
“when, finding himself in a paradise teeming with his fellow thugs, his seventy
houris arrive as a fistful of raisins.”17 However, what we should avoid at any cost
is precisely the cheap satisfaction provided by such discoveries of the original
meaning.
   In a homologous way, one can avoid responsibility and/or guilt by precisely
emphasizing in an exaggerated way one’s responsibility or by assuming guilt all
too readily, as in the case of the white male Politically Correct academic who
emphasizes the guilt of racist phallogocentrism, and uses this admission of
guilt as a stratagem NOT to confront the way he as a “radical” intellectual
perfectly fits the existing power relations towards which he pretends to be
thoroughly critical . . . Here also, the best mask of a thing is the thing itself . . .
Back to the Pope’s recommendation, it is easy to discern its noble purpose:

   The Pope wishes for God to be a God of love, loving and protecting us as
   our human fathers do here on Earth, and not a God willfully guiding us into
   danger. Yet to my most profound disappointment and sadness, this cannot
   be so, for in the Gospels, the very words of Jesus in the prayer itself tell us
   otherwise.18

However, is god not exposing us to temptation already in paradise where he
warns Adam and Eve not to eat the apple from the tree of knowledge—but why
did he put this tree there in the first place, and then even drew attention to it?
This is why Saint Theresa of Avila was right when she wrote: “More tears are
shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.” Was god not aware that
human ethics can arise only after the Fall? Many of the most insightful
theologians and Christian writers, from Kierkegaard to Paul Claudel, were
fully aware that, at its most basic, temptation arises in the form of the Good—
or, as Kierkegaard put it apropos Abraham, when he is ordered to slaughter
Isaac, his predicament “is an ordeal such that, please note, the ethical is the
temptation.”19 Is the temptation of the (false) Good not what characterizes all
forms of religious fundamentalism? And we should openly confront the
paradoxes implied by true ethics. Although John le Carré’s Russia House is not
                              The Politics of Vocation                        219


among his best works, it contains an immensely powerful chapter. The book’s
hero, Barley, the head of a small British publishing house, visits the USSR in the
years of perestroika to attend a writers’ retreat near Peredelkino. There he
encounters a man called Goethe, in fact a renowned physicist who has secretly
written a manuscript detailing the Soviet’s nuclear missile capabilities. Goethe’s
goal is to convince the West that USSR does not pose a real military threat (its
military capacities are much less developed than it appears) and, in this way, to
facilitate the end of the Cold War. When the CIA learns of Goethe’s manuscript,
it is concerned because the manuscript states that the Soviet nuclear missile
program is in complete disarray, and therefore there’s no real reason for an
arms race to continue. Instead of rejoicing, they panic, perceiving a danger for
their military complex, so they try to prove that Goethe’s manuscript is a Soviet
plot to delude the West. They invite Barley to the US where they subject him to
a long humiliating and aggressive interrogation. Barley appears to play the
game, but he ultimately breaks down, becomes disgusted with the situation,
and decides to offer his services to the KGB . . . The long chapter which details
Barley’s interrogation and his utter and painful disillusionment with CIA is by
far the strongest in the book, a true lesson in ethical integrity and in how,
sometimes, betrayal (of one’s own side) is the only way to act ethically.
   This brings us to the nihil obstat apropos the appearance of Mary in
Medjugorje. It is easy to discern its noble purpose: why prevent the goodness
of the spiritual fruits from Medjugorje from freely spreading and being shared
even if they are based on a lie? However, such a culturalization of Christianity,
treating it as a cultural phenomenon with no unconditional truth value,
inexorably leads us to censor the basic Christian texts themselves if they don’t
fit the prescribed task of spreading around the goodness of its spiritual fruits.
If we want to keep the Christian experience alive, we have to resist all
temptation to purge from it “problematic” passages—they are the very stuff
which confers on Christianity the unbearable tensions of a true life. Christianity
is a form of madness or it is a dead corpse. I never thought I would find myself
on the side of conservative critics of Pope Francis, but he took this cultural
direction too far when he recently said in a conversation with children in
Singapore:
220                              Quantum History


   All religions are paths to reach God. They are—to make a comparison—like
   different languages, different dialects, to get there. But God is God for
   everyone. If you start to fight saying my religion is more important than
   yours, mine is true and yours isn’t, where will this lead us? There is only one
   God, and each of us has a language to arrive at God. Some are Sikh, Muslim,
   Hindu, Christians; they are different ways to God.20

Two immediate counter-questions: what about there being no god, and what
about polytheists for whom there is more than one god? Furthermore, such a
reduction of different religions to different languages which express the same
god opens up the way to naturalism. In neurotheology, the study of religion
reached the extreme point of reductionism: its formula, “(our experience of)
god is (the product of neuronal processes in) our brain,” clearly echoes Hegel’s
formula of phrenology: “Spirit is a bone.” Hegel calls this the “infinite judgment”
which asserts the identity of the highest and the lowest, and no wonder that
neurotheology is often dismissed as a new version of phrenology—more
refined, for sure, but basically advocating the same correlation between the
processes or shapes in our head and psychic processes . . . The limitations of
this approach are obvious, and the lines of attacking it clearly predictable.
While these critical reactions to neurotheology have a certain weight, they
nonetheless ultimately founder upon a hard rock: if it was proven that, by
manipulating a subject’s neurons, one can effectively give rise to some kind of
mystical state in the subject, and that, in this way, one can experimentally
induce a religious experience, does this not indicate that our religious
experience is in some sense caused by neuronal processes in our brain? The
specific form of this experience, of course, depends on its cultural context and
on the thick web of socio-symbolic practices, and the precise causality, of
course, remains obscure, but—as Jacques Lacan would have put it—we do
encounter here a bit of the real which remains the same in all symbolic
universes.
   So the Pope’s words could be easily understood in neurotheological terms:
languages are different symbolizations of a Real which are neurological
processes in our brain. However, these lines could also be understood as a
version of Cultural Christianity: do they not imply that Christianity is just one
                             The Politics of Vocation                        221


of the possible symbolizations (cultural appearances) of the neurological Real?
This is not at all my position: for me, Christianity has its own repressed Real,
and it is at this level that its use for radical emancipatory movements is to be
sought. My position is much closer to that of Althusser who, in 1980, gave an
interview to Italian TV in Rome where he said:

  I became Communist because I was Catholic. I did not change religion, but
  I remained profoundly Catholic. I don’t go to church but this doesn’t matter;
  you don’t ask people to go to church today. I remained a Catholic, that is to
  say, an internationalist universalist. I thought inside the Communist party
  there were more adequate means to realize universal fraternity.21

Althusser is in good company here: Eric Satie, a devout Catholic, was also a
Communist—his sense of solidarity with the people led him to join the
Communist Party in 1913 after the murder of the party leader Jean Jaurès, and
he remained a card-carrying member until his death. If anything, I am here
much harsher than Althusser: I don’t advocate a simple unity of Christianity
and Communism. In my view, first, I am much closer to Protestantism
(Calvinism, more precisely) than Catholicism; second, for me, there is no place
for “all religions of the world” in my world. Calvinists combined, in a unique
way, predestination with free will and social activism. They

  argued against bishops and for lay-elders; they also wanted the ministry of
  the church to have an important measure of independence from the civil
  government. . . . the pastors of the church viewed themselves as prophetic
  critics of the political rulers. Calvinism also tended to teach a greater right
  of resistance and even revolution in the face of tyrannical government. All
  of this was held together under the notion of divine sovereignty. Quoting
  the Book of Acts, Calvinists would say, “We ought to obey God rather than
  men.” (Acts 5:29)22

The theological dimension is our only hope when we face the massive failure
of emancipatory transformation. Bolivia in the past two decades, a bright
exception, is now also approaching a failure: there is an open split in the
Moralista movement between Lucho Arse, a more technocratic president, and
Evo Morales who feels betrayed and, together with his supporters, is organizing
222                              Quantum History


armed local uprisings attacking military units and police. Whichever turn the
events will take, the Bolivian miracle seems over.
   But is Calvinism not—much more than Lutheran Protestantism—what
Max Weber had in mind when he emphasized the link between Protestantism
and capitalism? Is Calvinism not the ideological foundation of early capitalism
at its purest? Yes and no: we encounter here a typical dialectical reversal.
The problem with capitalism is that it cannot survive if, in its social reality, it
follows too closely its own ideological foundation—it can survive only through
permanent compromises with other traditions. What this means is that,
in order to fully actualize the ideological core of capitalism, we have to
transcend capitalism to another social formation, to Communism. In other
words, Calvinism is the ex-timate point of Christianity, a point of its potential
self-overcoming, in a similar way that Christianity is the ex-timate point in
the religious space, it is literally an atheist religion, its central event is the
death of god which opens up the way to Holy Spirit, to the freedom in
equality of a group which rejects social hierarchy. This atheist core of
Christianity is, of course, obfuscated in institutionalized Christianity whose
main effort is to erase its own subversive excess—which is why G.K. Chesterton
was right (as he usually is) when he wrote: “I believe in preaching to the
converted, for I have generally found that the converted do not understand
their own religion.”23
   The triad of Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Protestantism corresponds to the
Lacanian triad of Imaginary–Symbolic–Real: the horizon of Orthodoxy is that
of the imaginary fusion between man and god; Catholicism focuses on the
symbolic exchange between the two poles; Protestantism asserts the
“subtracted” god of the intrusion of the Real. The key doctrinal division
between Orthodoxy and Western Christianity (both Catholicism and
Protestantism) concerns the procession of the Holy Spirit: for the Latin
tradition, the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, while for the
Orthodox it proceeds from the Father alone. Apropos of this disputed question
of the origin of the Holy Spirit, Hegel committed a weird slip of the tongue: he
mistakenly claimed that for Orthodoxy, the Holy Spirit originates from both
Father and Son, and for Western Christianity from the Son alone (from Christ’s
Resurrection in the community of believers); as he wrote, the disagreement
                              The Politics of Vocation                        223


between East and West concerns knowing “if the Holy Spirit proceeds from the
Son, or from the Father and the Son, the Son being only the one who actualizes,
who reveals—thus from him alone the Spirit proceeds.”24
   For Hegel, it is thus not even thinkable for the Holy Spirit to proceed from
the Father alone—and my point is that there is a truth in this slip of the tongue.
Hegel’s underlying premise is that what dies on the Cross is not only god’s
earthly representative-incarnation, but the god of beyond itself: Christ is the
“vanishing mediator” between the substantial transcendent god-in-itself and
god qua virtual spiritual community. This “shift from subject to predicate” is
avoided in Orthodoxy, where God–Father continues to pull the strings, is not
really caught in the process: for Protestantism, Holy Spirit is the return of
Christ in the community of believers not supported by any big Other. It is also
only in this way that we can get rid of the ambiguous figure of the Devil—
ambiguous, because in traditional Christianity Devil plays a contradictory
role: he tempts us into sin and then organizes the punishment for our sins in
Hell. The most radical Protestants resolved this question by way of identifying
an evil dimension in god himself.
   How, then, do we pass from capitalism to Communism? For Noam Yuran,25
capitalism is not the mode of production in which everything has a price and
can be exchanged on the market, i.e., in which commodification is universalized.
It is in pre-capitalist societies that everything can be negotiated, exchanged for
a proper price, especially marriage which is a matter of negotiated exchange
between families and in this sense a business proposal, while in capitalism love
and marriage are exempted from market exchange: it is a bourgeois ideal to
marry for love. Insofar as we accept the thesis that Protestantism is the
exemplary religion of capitalist (at least till the middle of the twentieth
century), then the same holds for the passage from Catholicism to Protestantism.
In premodern Catholicism, our salvation is a matter of exchange, I can buy it
through my good works or even directly for money (this is what shocked so
much Luther: in Vatican it was possible to buy redemption not only for sins
already committed but even for future sins—say, I want to steal property from
my relative and if I pay to the Church an adequate sum, I can then do it without
endangering my salvation). In Protestantism, on the contrary, my salvation is
decided by god in advance (predestination), which means that it is not a
224                              Quantum History


matter of haggling, it doesn’t imply any form of market exchange, even the
most spiritual one.
   Paradoxically, it is this very limitation which sustains the space for capitalist
ever-expanding search of profit—a nice case of the Lacanian logic of all
(commercialization) grounded in a constitutive exception. And my crazy
hypothesis is that all we should do is to pass from the “masculine” logic of
universality grounded in an exception to the “feminine” logic of a space with
no exception which is for this very reason non-all: in (the lower stage, at least,
of) Communism, there is nothing money cannot buy and for this very reason
money cannot buy all there is.
   So, again, why Christian atheism? A reference to Marx may be of some help
here. Apropos of the Party of Order which took power when the revolutionary
élan of 1848 was over, Marx wrote that the secret of its existence was

   the coalition of Orléanists and Legitimists into one party, disclosed. The
   bourgeois class fell apart into two big factions which alternately—the big
   landed proprietors under the restored monarchy and the finance aristocracy
   and the industrial bourgeoisie under the July Monarchy—had maintained a
   monopoly of power. . . . the nameless realm of the republic was the only one
   in which both factions could maintain with equal power the common class
   interest without giving up their mutual rivalry.26

So when we are dealing with two or more socio-economic groups, their
common interest can only be represented in the guise of the negation of their
shared premise—the common denominator of the two royalist factions is
not royalism, but republicanism. (And, in the same way the only political
agent that consequently represents the interests of the capital as such, in its
universality, above its particular factions, was Tony Blair’s Third Way Social
Democracy . . .) Exactly the same holds for Christianity: it is not one among
religions but the only truly universal religion, the common denominator of all
religions, which can only assume the form of atheism (the death of god), of the
negation of their shared ground. And exactly the same holds also for the
Kantian ethics, an ethics with no supreme Good, a de facto atheist ethics of
autonomy: I am responsible not only to do my duty but to decide what this
duty is, with no reliance on a higher authority. To clarify this topic, one has to
                              The Politics of Vocation                         225


revisit Lacan’s topic of Kant avec Sade, of Sade as the truth of the Kantian
ethics.
   Here, however, we come close to a very touchy point. As Lacanians, we
should be especially attentive to shifts and inconsistencies in Lacan’s own
teaching. Perhaps the greatest shift occurs in the course of his seminar on the
ethics of psychoanalysis: there is a subtle but radical change in how he reads
the motif of “Kant with Sade.”27 At the beginning, he refers to Saint Paul, to
Paul’s notion of a law which enables (calls for) its sinful transgression, while
towards the end, law itself becomes the law of desire. To clarify this shift, let’s
begin with the famous passage from Paul’s Romans 7:

   So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of
   Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the
   dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. For when we were in the
   realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us,
   so that we bore fruit for death. But now, by dying to what once bound us, we
   have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the
   Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. What shall we say, then? Is
   the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what
   sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what
   coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.” But sin,
   seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me
   every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. Once I was
   alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to
   life and I died.28

One of the last echoes of this stance is found in the work of Georges Bataille
who for this reason remains strictly premodern, stuck in this dialectic of the
law and its transgression, of the prohibitive law as generating the transgressive
desire, which forces him to the debilitating perverse conclusion that one has to
install prohibitions in order to be able to enjoy their violation—a clearly
unworkable pragmatic paradox. What Bataille is unable to perceive is simply
the consequence of the Kantian philosophical revolution: the fact that the
absolute excess is that of the Law itself—the Law intervenes in the “homogeneous”
stability of our pleasure-oriented life as the shattering force of the absolute
226                              Quantum History


destabilizing heterogeneity. In Buddhism, you are taught to sacrifice desire in
order to attain the inner peace of Enlightenment in which sacrifice cancels
itself. For Lacan, the true sacrifice is desire itself: desire is an intrusion which
throws off the rails the rhythm of our life, it compels us to forfeit everyday
pleasures and comforts for discipline and hard work in the pursuit of the
object of our desire, be it love, a political Cause, science . . . In short, Lacan’s
reading of Kant’s ethics is not fully consistent. The basic line of Lacan’s reading
of Kant is adequately rendered in Russell Sbriglia’s summation of Joan Copjec’s
elaboration of her notion of the “sartorial superego”29:

   whereas utilitarianism blithely assumes that “man can be counted as zero,”
   psychoanalysis insists that, if counted man can indeed be, he can only be
   counted as “minus one.”30 Confident that the goal of man is the maximization
   of pleasure and that pleasure can therefore be used to regulate and manipulate
   man, utilitarianism presumes that “man is basically and infinitely
   manageable,” that he is, in short,“fundamentally ruly.”(85) The psychoanalytic
   objection to this supposition, Copjec clarifies, rests not on the protest that
   man is more than “rationalist engineers” like Bentham allows, but rather that
   “man is, in a manner, less” than utilitarians realize insofar as “he is radically
   separated from, and cannot know, what he wants”(87)—a separation and an
   unknowing that renders man fundamentally unruly. Hence Copjec’s
   conclusion that “the difference between the utilitarian and the Lacanian
   subject is the difference between zero and minus one, between a subject who
   is driven to seek the maximization of his pleasure in his own greater good,
   and a subject for whom pleasure cannot function as an index of the good,
   since the latter is lost to him”—lost because the subject is ultimately “subject
   to a principle beyond pleasure,” (87) that principle being, of course, what
   psychoanalysis dubs the death drive.

Up to this point I cannot but fully agree: for Kant, freedom effectively is not the
freedom to pursue one’s pleasures without constraints, it is on the contrary
“the freedom to resist the lure of the pleasure principle and to submit oneself
to the law of the death drive.”(96) Freedom does not reside in spontaneously
following one’s cravings, it is a form of resistance to these cravings, a form of
                               The Politics of Vocation                           227


self-control. But now we come to the problematic point: Lacan sees the limit of
Kant’s notion of categorical imperative in Kant’s ignorance of how the
distinction between the subject of the enunciated and the subject of enunciation
works in the case of categorical imperative—a failure that makes it seem as
though it “come[s] from nowhere,” which, in turn, allows the addressee to
“presume to occupy the vacant enunciative position” and “take itself as the
source of the statement”: “the ethical subject hears the voice of conscience as
its own.”(96–98) With his autonomous ethics, Kant thus “sealed up again the
gap he so dramatically opened” (96): it appears that the subject itself issues the
moral imperative he obeys in acting ethically.
   Again, in Lacanese, what Kant failed to do was to distinguish between the
subject of the enunciated (the subject of the statement that Kant correctly
understood the categorical imperative to be) and the subject of its enunciation
which is decentered with regard to the moral subject—this agency that pushes
the subject to act ethically is, of course, what psychoanalysis identifies as the
superego. This is where Sade comes in as the “truth” of Kantian ethics: the
categorical imperative is not libidinally neutral since the pain we, its subjects,
experience when doing our duty brings enjoyment to the decentered superego
agency. From this standpoint, we can claim that “acting ethically, paradoxically,
entails not identifying with the moral law (as in Kant), but dis-identifying with
it, it entails not heeding this ‘impulse,’ but ‘recoil[ing]’ in ‘moral revulsion’ (88)
from this ‘incomprehensible part of our being.’” (92)
                                    *
However, the actual “incomprehensible part of our being” is not superego but
desire itself which is constitutively decentered with regard to subject, desire
which makes the subject barred, a void. And, as it was formulated with brilliant
simplicity by Lacan, the reason Sade was not able to think the barred subject
($) resides in his misconception of the difference between the two deaths, the
biological death of the common mortal body and the death of the other
“undead” body: it is clear that what Sade aims at in his notion of a radical
Crime is the murder of this second body. Sade deploys this distinction in
the long philosophical dissertation delivered to Juliette by Pope Pius VI in
Book 5 of Juliette:
228                             Quantum History


   The human being, along with all organic life and even inorganic matter, is
   caught in an endless cycle of death and rebirth, generation and corruption,
   so that “there is indeed no real death,” only a permanent transformation and
   recycling of matter according to the immanent laws of “the three kingdoms,”
   animal, vegetable, and mineral. Destruction may accelerate this process, but
   it cannot stop it. The true crime would be the one that no longer operates
   within the three kingdoms but annihilates them altogether, that puts a stop
   to the eternal cycle of generation and corruption and by doing so returns
   to Nature her absolute privilege of contingent creation, of casting the dice
   anew.

What, then, at a strict theoretical level, is wrong with this dream of the “second
death” as a radical pure negation which puts a stop to the life-cycle itself? In a
superb display of his genius, Lacan provides a simple answer: “It is just that,
being a psychoanalyst, I can see that the second death is prior to the first, and
not after, as de Sade dreams it.” (The only problematic part of this statement is
the qualification “being a psychoanalyst”—a Hegelian philosopher can also see
this quite clearly.) In what precise sense are we to understand this priority of
the second death—the radical annihilation of the entire life-cycle of generation
and corruption—over the first death which remains a moment of this cycle?
Aaron Schuster points the way:

   Sade believes that there exists a well-established second nature that operates
   according to immanent laws. Against this ontologically consistent realm he
   can only dream of an absolute Crime that would abolish the three kingdoms
   and attain the pure disorder of primary nature.31

In short, what Sade doesn’t see is that there is no big Other, no Nature as an
ontologically consistent realm—nature is already in itself inconsistent,
unbalanced, destabilized by antagonisms. The total negation imagined by Sade
thus doesn’t come at the end, as a threat or prospect of radical destruction, it
comes at the beginning, it always-already happened, it stands for the zero-level
starting point out of which the fragile/inconsistent reality emerges. In other
words, what is missing in the notion of Nature as a body regulated by fixed
laws is simply subject itself: in Hegelese, the Sadean Nature remains a Substance,
                               The Politics of Vocation                          229


Sade continues to grasp reality only as Substance and not also as Subject, where
“subject” does not stand for another ontological level different from Substance
but for the immanent incompleteness-inconsistency-antagonism of Substance
itself. And, insofar as the Freudian name for this radical negativity is the death
drive, Schuster is right to point out how, paradoxically, what Sade misses in his
celebration of the ultimate Crime of radical destruction of all life is precisely
the death drive:

   for all its wantonness and havoc the Sadeian will-to-extinction is premised
   on a fetishistic denial of the death drive. The sadist makes himself into the
   servant of universal extinction precisely in order to avoid the deadlock of
   subjectivity, the “virtual extinction” that splits the life of the subject from
   within. . . . as Lacan argues, Sade is right if we just turn around his evil
   thought: subjectivity is the catastrophe it fantasizes about, the death beyond
   death, the “second death.” While the sadist dreams of violently forcing a
   cataclysm that will wipe the slate clean, what he does not want to know is
   that this unprecedented calamity has already taken place. Every subject is
   the end of the world, or rather this impossibly explosive end that is equally
   a “fresh start,” the unabolishable chance of the dice throw.

This brings us back to Kant, to Kant’s preeminence over Sade: Kant characterized
the free autonomous act as an act which cannot be accounted for in the terms
of natural causality, of the texture of causes and effects: a free act occurs as its
own cause, it opens up a new causal chain from its zero-point. So insofar as
“second death” is the interruption of the natural life-cycle of generation and
corruption, no radical annihilation of the entire natural order is needed for
this—an autonomous free act already suspends natural causality, and the
subject as $ already is this cut in the natural circuit, the self-sabotage of natural
goals. The mystical name for this end of the world is “night of the world,” and
the philosophical name, radical negativity as the core of subjectivity. And, to
quote Mallarmé, a throw of the dice will never abolish the hazard, i.e., the abyss
of negativity remains forever the unsublatable background of subjective
creativity. We may even risk here an ironic version of Gandhi’s famous motto
“be the change you want to see in the world”: the subject is itself the catastrophe
230                             Quantum History


it fears and tries to avoid. And is the lesson of Hegel’s analysis of the French
revolutionary terror not exactly the same (which is why the parallel between
Sade’s absolute crime and revolutionary terror is well grounded)? Individuals
threatened by the Terror have to grasp that this external threat of annihilation
is nothing but the externalized/fetishized image of the radical negativity of
self-consciousness—once they grasp this, they pass from revolutionary Terror
to the inner force of the moral Law.
   So I think Lacan ultimately doesn’t claim that the Kantian categorical
imperative is sustained by a Sadean superego injunction to enjoy: what happens
in an authentic ethical act is another dis-identification, a dis-identification
between the moral law and the superego. If my desire is sustained by a superego
imperative (as is the case in every form of transgressive desire, a desire that
thrives on violating what the law prohibits), then this desire is by definition
compromised—in acting in this way, I betray my desire.
   And to dispel the impression that we are dealing here with distinctions of
no practical or political interest, think about Ukraine today, in 2025. The
country is confronting a forced choice: life or freedom? However, this choice
has an additional twist: both choices imply death. If, in the present situation,
you choose life (surrender), you choose death (disappearance as a nation, as
Russia repeatedly made it clear). If you choose freedom (i.e., continued armed
resistance, but with the prospect of less Western support), you choose (for
many Ukrainians and their habitat) actual death and destruction.
   There is a French novel which seems to rely on the same choice: Julien
Gracq’s The Opposing Shore (the original title is Le rivage des Syrtes). “Syrtes”
refers to the southern-most region of Orsenna, a fictional stand-in for Italy
where there seem to be cars but no electricity, a country ruled by the ancient
and decadent city of the same name which seems to be, but isn’t quite, Venice.
For the past 300 years, Orsenna has been in a state of suspended war with
Farghestan, the barbarian desert country across the sea to the south; Farghestan,
with its two main cities on the coast and endless deserts, seems a great deal like
Libya, although some of the places change sides: Mount Etna moves to Libya
and becomes the Tängri; the ruins of Sabratha leave Libya for Italy and become
Sagra; Sirt goes to Italy and becomes Syrtes. Aldo, the novel’s narrator and
protagonist, belongs to one of the ruling families of Orsenna. Sent as a state
                               The Politics of Vocation                           231


observer to Orsenna’s dilapidated naval base of Syrtes, he crosses the forbidden
line that divides the dead sea by sailing to the city of Rhages on the enemy’s
shore. There his ship is welcomed with three cannon shots. Having by this
irreparable act rekindled the war that will destroy Orsenna, Aldo accomplishes
the suicidal gesture a whole people secretly yearned for: when he returns from
Syrtes to Orsenna, he discovers that the ruling elite of Orsenna is using the
pretense of a war with Farghestan to whip up nationalist patriotism . . . Beyond
the obvious reproach that Gracq is depicting the descent of Orsenna into
Fascism (evoking the external threat to create an emergency state, etc.), one
should discern here a deeper existential dilemma: what is more desirable, a
calm inert life of small satisfactions, not a true life at all, or taking a risk which
may well end in a catastrophe?
   However, Ukraine is not facing this choice but an almost exactly opposite
one. If it wants to return to calm daily life it needs to take the risk of pursuing
war (military resistance), i.e., of exposing itself to potential death. If it wants
to avoid war, it faces with great certainty another form of death (disappearance
as a nation under Russian occupation). One should note here that it is the
West which has the choice wrongly attributed to Ukraine: risking a war
(by supporting Ukraine) or choosing peaceful life (by suffering a humiliation
of betraying its ally). And, as many critical analysts are pointing out, even
the Western European choice of peace does not really guarantee a long-term
peace because if Russia gets Ukraine it will in all probability not stop there but
pursue its expansion towards the West, so that the European West will later
confront the same choice in much tougher conditions. Here, then, the Western
peaceniks (from Viktor Orban and other radical Right figures to pseudo-
Leftists) simply cheat by attributing the choice which is not even truly their
own to Ukraine.
   The ongoing war is not just a struggle for the control of territory or for
economic power. It is also more than an effort to annihilate a nation, although
the dimension of a genocide is clearly discernible in it—not in the literal sense
of killing all members of a nation but in the sense of depriving the survivors of
their ethnic identity and making them Russians. It is even more than an
indicator of a global geopolitical shift—it is a war of spirit against spirit, of two
mutually exclusive visions and practices of what a human being is. Maybe, we
232                              Quantum History


should return here to Nietzsche who, towards the end of the nineteenth
century, in Ecce Homo, presented his dark vision of the next century:

   For when Truth battles against the lies of millennia there will be shock
   waves, earthquakes, the transposition of hills and valleys such as the world
   has never yet imagined even in its dreams. The concept “politics” then
   becomes entirely absorbed into the realm of spiritual warfare. All the mighty
   worlds of the ancient order of society are blown into space—for they are all
   based on lies: there will be wars the like of which have never been seen on
   earth before.32

Before we dismiss these lines as obscurantist brooding, we should at least note
that Alain Badiou33, definitely not a Nietzschean, in his booklet The Century
arrives at similar conclusions. Badiou’s metaphor for the twentieth century is
the wounded body of a beast (a term he borrows from Osip Mandelstam’s
poem The Age, 1923). The beast was surviving the nineteenth century in a
relative state of comfort, caught in the illusion of gradual economic and
political progress. With the twentieth century, the beast got tired of patiently
approaching the imagined goal of progress—it decided to confront history
face to face and to fulfill the promises of the nineteenth century through acts
of brutal voluntarism. The result was, as Nietzsche predicted, a new kind of
“spiritual warfare”: two world “wars the like of which have never been seen on
earth before,” accompanied by a series of violent revolutions, and all this just
wounded the beast without giving rise to a New Man. So what will follow this
unique mixture of hope and brutal disappointment that was the twentieth
century? In The Will to Power, he extends his speculations to the next century
(ours, the twenty-first), noting that it would see “the total eclipse of all values,”
based on the rise of “barbaric nationalistic brotherhoods”:

   Nobody should be surprised when . . . brotherhoods with the aim of
   robbery and exploitation of the nonbelievers . . . appear in the arena of the
   future.34

Here we are now, and the irony is that those who advocate a return to traditional
old values are the most brutal in their “robbery and exploitation of35 the
nonbelievers.” We will all have to be ready to risk our lives, and the only

difference between Russia and Western Europe is that, as we have seen, Russia
claims it doesn’t fear death because it believes in a higher divine power which
will redeem Russians after their death, while we in Western Europe know that
there is no higher guarantee, that death is just death. Our hope is that Russia’s
readiness to die is a fake, part of a strategy of bluffing, but fake can also lead to
real consequences.
   In Lacanian terms, the true choice is not between life and death but between
the two deaths: symbolic death (loss of symbolic identity) and actual biological
death. Perhaps, this is the best definition of our global predicament today.

      Frozen beauty: Rovelli,
      Deleuze and the Stoics


When Rovelli determines the basic level of reality as composed not of things
but of events, i.e., as a pure flux of becoming which cannot be attributed to
anything, is there the temptation to establish a link between Rovelli and none
other than Gilles Deleuze and his notion of pure becoming without being (as
opposed to the metaphysical notion of pure being without becoming)? This
pure becoming is not a particular becoming of some corporeal entity, a passage
of this entity from one to another state, but a becoming-in-itself, thoroughly
extracted from its corporeal base. Since the predominant temporality of Being
is that of the present (with past and future as its deficient modes), the pure
becoming-without-being means that one should sidestep the present—it never
“actually occurs,” it is “always forthcoming and already past.”1
   As such, pure becoming suspends sequentiality and directionality: say, in an
actual process of becoming, the critical point of temperature (0 degrees
Celsius) always has a direction (water either freezes or melts), while, considered
as pure becoming extracted from its corporeality, this point of passage is not a
passage from one to another state, but a “pure” passage, neutral as to its
directionality, perfectly symmetric—for instance, a thing is simultaneously
getting larger (than it was) and smaller (than it will be).
   The Foucault closest to Deleuze is therefore the Foucault of The Archeology
of Knowledge, his underrated key work delineating the ontology of utterances
as pure language events: not elements of a structure, not attributes of subjects
who utter them, but events which emerge, function within a field, and disappear.

                                                                              237
238                               Quantum History


To put it in Stoic terms, Foucault’s discourse analysis studies lekta, utterances
as pure events, focusing on the inherent conditions of their emergence (as the
concatenation of events themselves) and not on their inclusion in the context
of historical reality. This is why the Foucault of The Archeology of Knowledge is
as far as possible from any form of historicism, of locating events in their
historical context—on the contrary, Foucault abstracts them from their reality
and its historical causality, and studies the immanent rules of their emergence.
What one should bear in mind here is that Deleuze is not an evolutionary
historicist; his opposition of Being and Becoming should not deceive us. He is
not simply arguing that all stable, fixed entities are just coagulations of the
all-encompassing flux of Life—why not? The reference to the notion of time is
crucial here. Let us recall how Deleuze (with Guattari), in his description of
becoming in/of philosophy, explicitly opposes becoming and history:

   “Philosophical time is thus a grandiose time of coexistence that does not
   exclude the before and after but superimposes them in a stratigraphic order.
   It is an infinite becoming of philosophy that crosscuts its history without
   being confused with it. The life of philosophers, and what is most external
   to their work, conforms to the ordinary laws of succession; but their proper
   names coexist and shine as luminous points that take us through the
   components of a concept once more or as the cardinal points of a stratum
   or layer that continually come back to us, like dead stars whose light is
   brighter than ever.”2

The paradox is thus that transcendental becoming inscribes itself into the
order of positive being, of constituted reality, in the guise of its very opposite, of
a static superimposition, historical development frozen and crystallized. This
Deleuzian eternity is, of course, not simply outside time; rather, in the
“stratigraphic” superimposition, in this moment of stasis, it is TIME ITSELF
which we experience, time as opposed to the evolutionary flow of things
WITHIN time.
   Deleuze thus inverts Plato’s dualism of eternal Ideas and their imitations in
sensuous reality into the dualism of substantial (material) bodies and the pure
impassive surface of Sense, the flux of Becoming which is to be located on the
very borderline of Being and non-Being. Senses are surfaces which do not
                    Frozen Beauty: Rovelli, Deleuze and the Stoics                239


exist, but merely subsist: “They are not things or facts, but events. We cannot
say that they exist, but rather that they subsist or inhere (having this minimum
of being which is appropriate to that which is not a thing, a nonexisting entity.”3
The Stoics, who developed this notion of “incorporeals,” were

   the first to reverse Platonism and to bring about a radical inversion. For if
   bodies with their states, qualities, and quantities, assume all the characteristics
   of substance and cause, conversely, the characteristics of the Idea are
   relegated to the other side, that is to this impassive extra-Being which is
   sterile, inefficacious, and on the surface of things: the ideational or the
   incorporeal can no longer be anything other than an “effect.”4

The Stoics thus opened up a unique alternate line of thought, clearly opposed
to the substantialist metaphysics, which resurfaces in early Wittgenstein (“The
world is all that is the case. . . . The world is the complete sum of facts, not of
things.”), in Whitehead, and in Deleuze. At the top of the Stoics’ ontological
hierarchy we find the ti, “somethings,” which are divided into the on and the me
on, the sphere of the existent and the sphere of the non-existent. To the on
belong the somata, the things that can perform or undergo actions; to the me
on belong the void, place, time, and the lekta. These four asomata do not have
an independent existence of their own; they are only thought and said. What is
predicated of a soma is an event that occurs at the periphery of the domain in
which bodies act and are acted upon; the actuality of the event entirely derives
from the body by which it is caused. Lekton is that which exists kata logiken
phantasian, by way of a presentation which is typical of a living being possessed
of reason and speech, or also ekphorika, things capable of being expressed in
words. Lekta are merely thought and nothing directly corresponds to them in
the world of existing somata.5
   Consequently, Stoics draw a strict distinction between logic and language:
language is sound, it is corporeal, material, and sensible, part of the world of
real being, while logic falls within the category of the incorporeals—logical
statements are lekta, sayables, they have meaning, but since they are not
corporeal, they do not have full being. This distinction is the same as the one
between a cause, which is a body, soma, and that of which it is the cause, which
is called symbebekos, consequence, or kategorema, predicate. The lancet and the
240                                Quantum History


flesh are bodies; the lancet is the cause of an asomatic kategorema, namely
being cut, with respect to the flesh. Fire and wood are bodies; the fire is the
cause of an asomatic kategorema, namely being burnt, with respect to the
wood. If the sun or the sun’s heat makes the wax melt, we have to say that
the sun is the cause, not of the melting of the wax, but of the wax being melted,
of a kategorema which is indicated by an infinitive.
   Upon closer inspection, we see that things are already more complicated
in Plato himself: Plato’s idea is not a thing beyond illusory appearances,
it is phenomenal, the idealized look of an object, its appearance, how it
looks to a gaze—in its “idea,” the ever-changing materiality of an object
“collapses” for an ideal observer into its frozen look appearance. Plato’s idea,
therefore, doesn’t belong to somata: material things incessantly change (the
late Plato calls the material substrate hora), while the idea is a frozen surface
that remains (I see the same idea “table” although my perception of it changes
all the time).
   But is this all, is the duality of somata and lekta the last word? For Badiou,
the primary fact is multiplicity of multiplicities and the One comes after,
through counting-as-One; for Deleuze, the productive-immanent One of the
Life flux immanently generates multiplicity; for Lacan, multiplicity emerges
against the background of minus One—in short, the absence/failure of One is
immanent to multiplicity, it is its determining absence, i.e., there is multiplicity
because the One is barred by its immanent impossibility. Or, to put it in more
speculative Hegelian terms: the One arises as the effect of its own impossibility
(like the subject which is the result of its own failure to become subject). In
Berlin, you can order beer “mit ohne,” “with without” (or just with-out!), to
distinguish it from beers which are with different fruit extracts (“Berliner
Weiss,” white, which can be green or red . . .). So, insofar as “white” is the neutral
color, it is this non-existing “white” which has three species: rot, gruen, and
ohne—red, green, and without (in the same way the empty set is an element of
every set, or the proletarians are in society “mit ohne,” since their proper place
is no place). The primordial state is thus not a simple innumerable and
inconsistent multiplicity, but a multiplicity with/out One, marked by an
immanent obstacle which prevents it becoming One.6 One lacks, it is “one less,”
and this lack is in itself a positive fact, it triggers repetition/drive. It is precisely
                      Frozen Beauty: Rovelli, Deleuze and the Stoics          241


because the One is lacking that the inconsistent multiplicity appears to itself,
re-presents itself.
                                  *
There is a double difference between Deleuze’s and Rovelli’s notion of
becoming. Rovelli asserts becoming not as opposed to things but as the
primordial/basic state of reality itself, while for Deleuze lekta are passive,
effects caused by bodily things. Here is the first stanza of “Casta Diva” from
Bellini’s Norma: “Casta Diva, che inargenti / queste sacre antiche piante, / a noi
volgi il bel sembiante / senza nube e senza vel . . .” (“O chaste Goddess, who
silver / These sacred ancient plants, / turn towards us a beautiful semblance /
cloudless and unveiled . . .” Performed in a night ceremony in the midst of a
sacred forest, the incantation addresses Moon, not Sun—that’s why the
Goddess is chaste, not primarily in the sense of purity but more in the sense of
sterility: even when we see it unveiled, without clouds, the light of the Moon is
not fertile, it is a mere semblance (although a beautiful one), a pale silver echo
of the golden light of the Sun, like the Deleuzian flow of Sense which is a pale
effect of the bodily causality. For Rovelli, on the contrary, becoming is not a
phenomenon of language (lekta) but reality itself. So does relational quantum
mechanics (RQM) not provide an ontological counterpart to lekta?

If there is a self-proclaimed Hegelian who is profoundly anti-Hegelian, it is the
Italian philosopher of Fascism Giovanni Gentile (killed in 1944 in Florence by
Communist partisans). He called his thought “actualism” or “actual idealism”:
his basic premise is that mind (self-consciousness of individuals always located
in a wider national identity) creates all reality, spiritual and material. At its
most basic, even the State is not a material entity embodied in its institutions
but a spiritual entity which is not opposed to individuals as a higher power but
one with them. For this reason, thinking is one with practice, it is a reflection
which is simultaneously creative. Gentile’s idealism is thus an absolute
immanentism: there is no transcendent material or spiritual (divine) reality.
The highest achievement of humanity is a Fascist nation-state which creates
the conditions of individual freedom—Gentile co-wrote with Mussolini
himself The Doctrine of Fascism, the foundational text of Italian Fascism . . .
Gentile deploys a caricatural version of absolute idealism, and it immediately
strikes the eye how non-Hegelian this vision is: there is no unavoidable
development through antagonisms and deceptions, no “la verite surgit de la
meprise,” no vertiginous dialectical reversals, just the discarding of all forms
of materialism, liberal individualism and transcendence and the vision of
a positive state in which spirit reigns supreme and where all is One
(individuals=nation=state=Leader . . .) in this spiritual unity. All things of
some interest that are taking place in the ongoing revival of Hegel studies go
against Gentile’s vision.

                                                                             243
244                               Quantum History


   There are, of course, many forms of this revival, and I count my own work
in this space. Jure Simoniti’s The Contingent Universal, which also belongs to
this space, is an extraordinary achievement, a fully elaborated systematic
philosophical vision which focuses on the speculative identity of contingency
and universality.1 Since throughout his book Simoniti critically deals with my
work—and I consider his critical remarks by far the most accurate among all
my critics—I feel obliged to analyze his reproaches in detail.
   Simoniti’s starting point is that “the world is not ‘universal’ in its given,
panoramic entirety, but has first to contract into its hic et nunc in order to
produce its universality in the first place”: “there is nothing that can fixate the
contingency of the present moment but the emergence of a universal; and
universality is no more than the very form of the world being present to itself
in its contingent locality.” The mutual implication of the two passages is crucial:
it’s not only that universality has to contract itself into a contingent singularity
that is less than any of its particularities—if we say only this we remain within
the ultra-nominalist idea that every universality is grounded in a singular
historical point. More is needed: to locate itself in its contingent unique place,
to grasp itself in its uniqueness, singularity itself needs the form of universalities.
Does the same movement of reduction to a singular point and then of the
expansion to a new universality not form the very core of Christianity? The
entire universe is contracted in the singular figure of Christ, a miserable
individual dying on the cross; through his death, he then returns as a new
universality of the Holy Ghost. Plus does the same not hold also for Lenin and
Mao? Shocked by the “patriotic” turn of most European social democracies,
Lenin totally rethought the notion of a Communist revolution, and Mao had
already done the same in the 1930s, shifting the focus from workers to farmers.
In sciences, we get this double movement at its purest in quantum mechanics—
recall Carlo Rovelli’s claim that “if we want to get a true idea of what a point of
space-time is like we should look outward at the universe . . . The complete
notion of a point of space-time in fact consists of the appearance of the entire
universe as seen from that point.”2 So first every vision or notion of the universe
is located or grounded in a singular standpoint of an observer, and then, to
grasp this observer in its singularity, we have to analyze how the entire universe
is reflected in or appears from this unique standpoint.
                         No Substitute for True Universals                   245


  In the history of philosophy, such a double movement is clearly present in
the Socratic revolution which is characterized by two features. First, it is a
reaction to the general crisis of the Greek social life which, for Socrates, is
embodied in the widespread popularity of sophists, performers of empty
rhetorical tricks who enacted a self-worsting of the tradition of polis. Second,
what Socrates opposes to this decay is not a simple return to the glorious past
but a radical self-questioning. The basic procedure of Socrates is the endless
repetition of the formula: “What, exactly, do you mean by . . .?”—by virtue,
truth, the Good, and similar basic notions? Today, we need the same
questioning: what do we mean by equality, freedom, human rights, the people,
solidarity, emancipation, and all other similar words which we use to legitimize
our decisions? The point is thus not to return to European legacy but to bring
it back by way of rethinking it thoroughly.
  Socrates should be opposed here to a pre-Socratic panoramic view over the
totality of the cosmos: although pre-Socratics are already philosophers, they
continue the pre-philosophical cosmogony by approaching the universe in its
All and directly searching for its substantial principle (water—not earth—for
Thales, change for Heraclitus, atoms for Democritus . . .), Socrates enacts a
withdrawal to the void of pure subjectivity (“all I know is that I know nothing”)
and then proceeds to questioning—what? Not reality but the meaning of
words:

  It is precisely words that now present themselves as small, close at hand,
  freely accessible entrances to the abyss of non-meaning behind the veil of
  things. While the world in its givenness conveys the impression of
  representing a lawful order, and its phenomena appear to be classifiable
  under particular symbolic rubrics, it is, quite paradoxically, only the
  universals themselves (i.e., concepts, notions, words) that are semantically
  volatile enough to allow a glimpse into the lack of any metaphysical, ideal,
  and semantic guarantee, and hence into the utter contingency governing
  everything. It seems that, while a panoramic view over the world still yields
  the feeling that things unfold according to some invisible laws acting behind
  them, only the repeatable, seemingly fixed universal is an entity externalized
  enough to bring to light the pure element of chance. Look at things, and you
246                             Quantum History


   will see the necessity of laws; but now examine closely a word, and you will
   recognize pure chance at its origin!

Is this reduction to questioning the meaning of words which exposes the
nothingness at its core not the best compact description of what Hegel is doing
in his Logic? Hegel begins his philosophy not by analyzing reality but by
deploying the vertiginous dance and reversals of words (the universals we use
to grasp reality) caught in their “mutual and differential definition”. No wonder
Hegel praised Plato’s Parmenides as his highest speculative achievement:
Parmenides designates Plato’s failure of his attempt to define Ideas in their
fixed substantial identities—Ideas get caught in their vertiginous dance against
the background of an irreducible nothingness which, in this case, means the
ultimate collapse of their meaning. The late Plato then almost regresses to
pre-philosophical cosmological dualism by means of which he tries to fill in
this abyss.3 Both cases thus invert the standard metaphysical opposition of
material reality in its constant change and the stable universe of Ideas: reality
is inert, stable, caught in some higher laws, while the world of words and their
universal meanings opens up a space of utter instability and void—and, therein
resides Plato’s lesson, one has to pass through this instability and void to reach
a new Universality.
   One should oppose here the Socratic questioning to the Confucian
“rectification of names.” When, in the fifth to third centuries BC, China went
through the period of the “Warring States,” Confucians perceived as the
ultimate cause of this slow but persistent decay the betrayal of old traditions
and customs. Most troubling to Confucius was his perception that the political
institutions of his day had completely broken down. He attributed this collapse
to the fact that those who wielded power as well as those who occupied
subordinate positions did so by making claim to titles for which they were not
worthy. When asked about the principles of good government, Confucius is
reported to have replied: “Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler,
the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a
son.” Confucius’ analysis of the lack of connection between things and their
names and the need to correct such circumstances is usually referred to as his
teaching on zhengming, the “rectification of names” (this name itself is a
                          No Substitute for True Universals                    247


symptomatic misnomer: what should be rectified are acts—they should be
made to correspond to their names): “If language is not correct, then what is
said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is meant, then what must
be done remains undone; if this remains undone, morals and art will
deteriorate; if justice goes astray, people will stand about in helpless confusion.
Hence there must be no arbitrariness in what is said. This matters above
everything.”4 The crisis was resolved by “Legalists” who dropped the very
coordinates of such a perception of the situation: for the Confucians, the land
was in chaos because old traditions were not obeyed, and states like Qin with
their centralized-military organization dismissive of the old customs were
perceived as the embodiment of what is wrong. However, in contrast to his
teacher Xunzi who regarded nations like Qin as a threat to peace, Han Fei
“proposed the unthinkable, that maybe the way of the Qin government was
not an anomaly to be addressed, but a practice to be emulated.”5 The solution
resided in what appeared as a problem: the true cause of the troubles was not
the abandonment of old traditions, but these traditions themselves which daily
demonstrated their inability to serve as guiding principles of social life.
Legalists triumphed and united China for the first time under one king—in
short, they fully asserted the convergence of universality and contingency in
all its explosive dimension. Although the post-Hegelian post-metaphysical
thought also endeavours to liberate the actual particular reality from its
metaphysical universal shackles, it is in effect

   nothing more than the series of detours of not letting it happen.
   Supplementary frames are set in motion to prevent the contact between
   universality and contingency/, but their fallacies may betray that they
   misunderstand the very object they were intended to grasp. . . . There is no
   need for an all-encompassing, metaphorical, panoramic, and complacently
   nihilist investiture of cosmic chance; for there is no contingency other than
   the audacity of a local place to act universally.

When Simoniti defines singularity as “nothing but particularity that has lost its
backing in the existence of metaphysical universals,” I am tempted to add that
singularity is also universality divested of all of its particular determinations—
in this sense, in the notion of a pure subject singularity coincides with
248                              Quantum History


universality: I am this unique One, a subject at a distance from its particular
properties and thus universal. Furthermore, is the key to the triad UPS which
undermines the couple of universality and particularity not the inclusion of
the subject of enunciation into the enunciated content? Enunciation is
inscribed into the enunciated as the excessive/lacking particular that is
excluded from (that has no place in) the classificatory order of particulars.
Let’s take the case of transhumanists: with all their warning about how we are
on the brink of a post-human era, they effectively remain too humanist. That is
to say, when they describe the possibility of intervening into our biogenetic
base and changing our very “nature,” they somehow presuppose that the
autonomous subject freely deciding on his/her acts will still be here, deciding
on how to change his “nature.” They thus bring the split between the “subject of
the enunciated” and the “subject of enunciation” to its extreme: on the one
hand, as an object of my interventions, I am a biological mechanism whose
properties, including the mental ones, can be manipulated; on the other hand,
I (act as if I) am somehow exempted from this manipulation, an autonomous
individual who, at a distance, can make the right choices. So the way to
undermine neuronal determinism is not by remaining focused on the object
of investigation and showing how transhumanists misunderstand their object,
but to raise another question: which is the subjective position of enunciation
of a transhumanist, the position from which he deploys his argumentation? Is
this position itself not something that doesn’t fit its content?
   So where do I fit into this edifice? Here is how Simoniti recapitulates the gap
that separates his philosophical edifice from mine:

   while Žižek could perhaps be reproached with finding in quantum physics
   an “instant ontology” capable of providing the infrastructure for his claims
   of ethical universalism, [Simoniti’s] book’s cooptation of modern science
   operates on a very different level. Our claim is not to seek in the real world
   the impulses for the proliferation of forms that are obviously irreducible to
   it, but to offer a logic that detaches the dawn of the new from its causal
   embedding in the chain of sufficient reasons. The philosophical recourse to
   modern science does not seek to construct a narrative that leads from
   physical conditions to the emergence of life forms, human societies, and
                         No Substitute for True Universals                    249


   ultimately philosophy. Rather, it uses science only as a special case of how
   the impulse of universality is in no way ideally predestined by antecedent
   circumstances, but fills the emergent space that extends precisely where
   there is no background support.

The starting point of philosophy is thus a given positive order in which some
traditional universality seems to control and regulate the constellation: all
particular content appears to be firmly embedded in the global order
determined by the chain of sufficient reasons. The first move of philosophy is
to locate the cracks in this edifice, the exception which doesn’t fit into the
global order; for Marx, this element is the working class which, by its objective
social position, is the point of its “symptomal torsion”(Alain Badiou)—workers
are, to quote Jacques Ranciere, a “part of no-part” of the social body, lacking a
proper place in it, an antagonism embodied. It is thus crucial to insist on the
Communist-egalitarian emancipatory Idea, and insist on it in a very precise
Marxian sense: there are social groups which, on account of their lacking a
determinate place in the “private” order of social hierarchy, directly stand for
universality. All truly emancipatory politics is generated by the short-circuit
between the universality of the “public use of reason” and the universality of
the “part of no-part”—this was already the Communist dream of the young
Marx: to bring together the universality of philosophy with the universality of
the proletariat. Simoniti emphasizes how this point of exception is the point of
singularity whose very existence undermines the global order within which it
appears; however, at the same time, this reduction to a singular radically
contingent moment opens up the path to construct a new universality that
cannot be deduced from the totality it undermines—the new universality
emerges through in a radically contingent way. This view has radical
consequences for the notion of philosophy:

   philosophy does indeed have no positive object of its own, such as physical
   phenomena, biological forms, social facts, linguistic conventions, existential
   claims and sensibilities, ethical norms, artistic creations, etc., which is why
   it is always dependent on extrinsic imagery. . . . In its objectless quality,
   philosophy will thus reveal something about the world that positive science
   and concrete politics cannot. It is the realization that to the extent that
250                              Quantum History


   philosophy lacks a natural object, the world is also in want of any first
   foundation, any original truth, or any generative principle. To put it another
   way, philosophy comes second because universality and truth themselves
   always come in last.

The key question to be raised here is: OK, but how does the hegemony of ideal
forms arise in the first place? Simoniti is at his weakest when he proposes a
six-steps “speculative reconstruction of how reality engenders the form of
ideality”:

   First, in the logical space of the prohibition of both ideal intervention and
   of real predetermination, reality, left to itself, illuminates the light of the
   Gegenwart. Sub specie realis, to put it this way, the existence of the present
   moment may be the most basic fact of this world, a “primitive” that cannot
   be further analyzed. Sub specie idealis, however, the scandal of the Gegenwart
   can be seen as the direct expression of a reality that has no reason and no
   ideal value to draw on. . . . the world unfolds only through its Gegenwarten,
   because it searches in the light of day for its ground and its reason, which
   were not given to it at its birth. Second, it is in this momentary illumination
   of the Gegenwart that the elements of the non-ideal real experience the
   weight of singularity. They cannot but be where they are, without the
   possibility of shaking off their thereness. As a consequence, a differentiation
   takes place in the field of utterly contingent locales.

It is at this point that I thoroughly disagree with Simoniti—his account reads like
a “speculative reconstruction” which presupposes much more than it explains—
it reads like a new version of speculative genesis in the style of Jacob Boehme or
late Schelling; his reference to sciences—“it is not the task of philosophy to give
an account of how this happens; these processes are the subject of science. What
philosophy contributes is merely the logic of the strict immanence of idealities
arising within the field of reality.”—just masks his failure. Already the starting
point is suspiciously ambiguous: what does “the logical space of the prohibition
of both ideal intervention and of real predetermination” effectively amount
to? Is this prohibition just an epistemological instrument to imagine the
ontological beginning, the zero-point of pure contingency where there is no
                           No Substitute for True Universals                       251


ideal intervention and no real predetermination, or is this prohibition to be
thought as something inscribed into reality itself—is this not the only way to
account for the fact that the zero-point reality which has no reason and no ideal
value to draw on “searches in the light of day for its ground and its reason, which
were not given to it at its birth”? In other words, the only way to account for the
fact that “a differentiation takes place in the field of utterly contingent locales” is
to posit that this “field of utterly contingent locales” is already marked by a
certain radical lack, that it already functions against the background of a certain
impossibility. Simoniti seems to ignore the question of where this lack (which
propels the field of contingent locales to search for its ground and its reason)
comes from, and it is here that I differ from his vision: for me, the starting point
is not a field of utterly contingent locales but a cut/gap which stands for fall from
the field of pure contingency—in short, it all begins with a crack, a fall, that
affects any imagined beginning.
   Simoniti also argues that I get caught in a hidden teleological circle: when I
claim that the quantum universe strangely resembles some features of the
symbolic universe (retroactivity, actuality of what is merely potential, etc.), am
I not claiming (using Schellingian terminology) that the quantum universe is
our symbolic universe at a lower potency (degree of power)? And does this not
imply that there is a kind of direct developmental link between the quantum
universe and our symbolic universe, as if the quantum universe is already in
itself the symbolic universe, i.e., as if the emergence of the symbolic universe is
not radically contingent but inscribed into reality as its immanent potential?
Let me try to clarify this crucial point by way of beginning with the key
problem of quantum mechanics which Simoniti himself tries to answer with
his speculative reconstruction: the domain of quantum waves is a domain of
contingency, so how do these waves collapse into our deterministic reality? It
is crucial not to elevate quantum processes into a unique ultimate reality and
then try to deduce from it how collapse happens: there is a gap at work in
quantum there from the very beginning. I think this aspect is missed by Simoniti
when, in his critique of my work, he focuses on the role quantum physics plays
in my theoretical edifice, denouncing it as “a veritable symptom” of my
philosophy:
252                              Quantum History


   It seems that when a system of thought invents concepts that are too big for
   its time, so that the tools for their ultimate analytic eventuation and
   grounding are still lacking, it tends to rely on a kind of “instant ontology”
   that could give legs to its untimely ideas. The most innovative part of the
   theory’s truth procedure is thus somehow providentially foreshadowed at
   the more fundamental level of given reality. . . . Our guess and our hope,
   however, is that the missing algorithm to ground his philosophy and make
   quantum metaphors unnecessary is precisely the logic of “contingent
   universality.”

A very precise and insightful critique—but does it hold? Let us dig deeper into
Simoniti’s argumentation: my “theoretical coalition with quantum mechanics
might admittedly strike us as a surrogate for the lacking ‘ground theory of
being,’ but Žižek only resorts to it because it is, in his view, the only scientific
worldview which already at the basic level of materiality manifests the
entwinement of the symbolic and the real, the subject and objectivity.” The
critique implied by this passage is that my privileging of quantum mechanics
among sciences has the same role as the post-metaphysical universal statements
which transform the assertion of contingency into a universal feature perceived
from an external panoramic view. Simoniti addresses the same reproach to my
twin basic notions, the Hegelian self-relating negativity and the Freudian death
drive: they “could be interpreted as two reactive principles making their way
through the new ontological landscape outlined by mutually defining chance
events and universal claims,” i.e., they

   pose as auxiliary expressions of the absence of any such all-encompassing,
   omnipotent cosmic governance. The pervasion of being by negation in
   Hegel merely indicates that no real identity is ideally warranted. And when
   this original negativity folds back upon itself and becomes self-referential, it
   marks the moment when its sheer contingency unfolds into its own
   universal dimension, whose “secondary lawfulness” ensures that there are
   no identities except those produced in the process of negation. Similarly, the
   essential repetitiveness of drive in Freud parasitizes on the fact that desires
   have no natural objects by which they can be permanently satisfied. . . . In
   short, Hegel’s negativity and Freud’s drive seem to be located at the point at
                          No Substitute for True Universals                    253


   which throwing oneself into the arms of contingency, for lack of any other
   way out, is doomed to establish its own emergent universality.

Simoniti’s aim is, of course, to resist this temptation to which post-metaphysics
regularly succumbs: in post-metaphysics,

   ontology broke apart into the singularist theories of being on one pole and
   the outward, miraculous universals on the other. Under the pretext of
   daring to disclose much more desolate cosmic landscapes than before, the
   post-Hegelians unconsciously still insisted on the contrastive fixity of
   substitute universals which were impervious to the muck of the here and
   now. It may thus very well be that gods, overmen, fateful events, and
   existential attitudes were only conjured because they promised to resist the
   semantic nihilism of dialectics.

So is self-relating negativity and/or death drive really my own “substitute
universal” which allows me to “resist the semantic nihilism of dialectics”?
Quite the opposite: self-relating negativity and/or death drive is my name for
this very “semantic nihilism of dialectics”; they are not positive ontological
notions, they just point towards an original gap. Simoniti wants a philosophy
without symptom, but the price he pays for it is that he himself produces a
mega-symptom, his vision of how the established order emerges out of the
primordial contingency. My reference to quantum mechanics is not just
another symptom: for me, the only way to avoid fake-ontological symptoms is
to confront the question “What happens prior to a truth event?”—in short,
how is reality structured so that contingent truth events can take place in it?
For me the only way to answer this question is: there must be a gap that is at
work in it from the very beginning. In its classic form, quantum mechanics
insists on the irreducible gap that separates the domain of quantum waves and
superpositions from the single reality of our daily lives, and it gets caught then
into the problem of how to conceptualize the passage between the two. The
classical formula of this passage is that of the collapse of the wave function, and
the entire history of quantum mechanics is full of attempts to explain how this
collapse functions, from outrightly denying it in the Many Worlds theory
(there is no collapse of waves to a single reality since the wave superpositions
254                               Quantum History


are all actualized in multiple realities) up to the idea that, since collapse into a
single reality happens through its registration by an observer, our universe
only exists by way of being observed by a divine global gaze. There is, as
expected, a great effort to avoid both these extremes by way of deploying how
the wave oscillations immanently (without any external observer) collapse
into a single reality though a process of decoherence; most of these attempts
rely on a criterion of quantity: wave oscillations occurs at the subatomic level,
and when we move to larger entities, they automatically collapse . . .
   In a similar, although more systematic, way Rovelli tries to reduce the gap
between a quantum process and its observer by way of universalizing the
notion of observation/registration: whenever multiple quantum processes
interact, they are “observed” by each other. The price he pays for this is that he
is compelled to universalize contingency in formulations which perfectly fit
what Simoniti calls “substitute universal.” Rovelli is a radical singularist, but he
universalizes this position: “RQM is complete in the sense of exhausting
everything that can be said about nature.” In a strict parallel to Simoniti’s
mythic “genesis” of the given deterministic order from the primordial pure
contingency, the last chapter of Rovelli’s Helgoland, which aims at providing
the genesis of our ordinary spatio-temporal reality from the basic domain of
wave functions, fails, I think. No wonder that Rovelli seems to get caught in the
traditional philosophical paradox when he argues that

   it is impossible for a system to have information about itself because it
   requires it to stand in a particular correlation to itself and this is not possible.
   It is not a new idea that quantum mechanics cannot describe the observers.
                                                                                (102)

As I wrote in Chapter 3, relational quantum mechanics returns us to an old
problem expressed by the liar’s paradox. Rovelli writes: “The world is like a
collection of interrelated points of view. To speak of the world ‘seen from
outside’ makes no sense because there is no ‘outside’ to the world.”(109) Another
universal statement, confirming Simoniti’s diagnosis that “the ‘external
totalization’ of the field of singularities unrolled the homogenous plane of
sheer contingencies as something that can be recognized and known in one
sweep, neutrally, declaratively, and as if from an outside perspective.”
                            No Substitute for True Universals                        255


   When Rovelli posits that quantum events exist only in interactions and that
the character of each quantum event is only relative to the system involved in the
interaction, so that different observers can give different accounts of the
actuality of the same physical property, i.e., when he claims that the occurrence
of an event is not something absolutely real or not but is only real in relation
to a specific observer, are these and similar claims universally true (true
independently of any observer) or are they also valid only in relation to a
specific (human) observer? The only way to assert their universal validity
without presupposing a global external observer is to base such universal claims
on an immanent limitation or boundary of reality itself. Put it in another way,
one can only avoid the neutral/external position of enunciation if one admits/
posits a limitation as the only “universal” feature. In short, the only way to limit
a space from within, not from an external point of observation, is to posit the
coincidence of the two limits: the external limitation coincides with an internal
one, i.e., a space is already “in itself ” not-all, not identical to itself. This paradox
only occurs in differential systems which form a complete totality by way of
including among its elements a mark of their own incompleteness—and
quantum mechanics moves in a space characterized by differentiality. This
limitation from within is what characterizes the pre-ontological Real, and it
also enables us to clarify the ambiguous relationship between the Lacanian
Real and the Void in the so-called Oriental thought. Here we encounter critics
which confront my work at a much lower level than Simoniti. I am often
reproached for not really understanding Buddhist and Hindu thinkers and the
associated traditions—suffice it to quote two passages from a Reddit site:

   Zizek is wrong when he says Eastern’s approach to “looking inwards to
   achieve knowledge” will lead to find hate so we should avoid it. He is
   extremely wrong about this because he doesn’t understand Brahman,
   Bhagavad Gita, or even the philosophies of Quakerism (which in fact are
   western!). All of them teach that when you truly look inside to find
   knowledge, what you will find is that we are all part of the same, and we
   should find a way to heal by uniting in peace. If Himmler used that to logic
   “I am not my actions therefore I can do whatever I want” then he didn’t
   really look inward, but instead only scratched the surface enough to justify
   his evil actions to himself (which is just Ego). Himmler did not achieve
256                              Quantum History


  gnosis, otherwise he would’ve understood that “Jews are the same as him,
  and therefore he wouldn’t have committed genocide.”

  In an interview he did with The Times, he also said how the issue with
  Oriental philosophy is that it says to ‘look deeply within yourself and find
  truth,’ while Slavoj believes ‘if you look, you will find nothing there. The self
  is an illusion.” The ignorance of this is amazing, because that’s exactly what
  Oriental religion is all about!6

The first thing that strikes the eye is the obvious contradiction between these
two reproaches (formulated by different persons): if we look deep into
ourselves, do we find there nothing or do we see that we are all part of the
same, and we should find a way to heal by uniting in peace? The difference is
here the one between Gita which advocates the unity of my soul and god, and
Buddhist which posits that there is no substantial self behind the appearances,
so that the self is an illusion, and Himmler adored Gita, not Buddhism—why?
Here is how, in Gita’s central passage, the God Krishna answers Arjuna, the
warrior-king who hesitates entering a battle, horrified at the suffering his
attack will cause—an answer worth quoting in detail:

  He who thinks it to be the killer and he who thinks it to be killed, both know
  nothing. The self kills not, and the self is not killed. It is not born, nor does
  it ever die, nor, having existed, does it exist no more. Unborn, everlasting,
  unchangeable, and primeval, the self is not killed when the body is killed. . . .
  As a man, casting off old clothes, puts on others and new ones, so the
  embodied self, casting off old bodies, goes to others and new ones. . . . It is
  everlasting, all-pervading, stable, firm, and eternal. It is said to be
  unperceived, to be unthinkable, to be unchangeable. . . . Therefore you ought
  not to grieve for any being. Having regard to your own duty also, you ought
  not to falter, for there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous
  battle. . . . Killed, you will obtain heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth.
  Therefore arise, o son of Kunti, resolved to engage in battle.7

So it is NOT that “when you truly look inside to find knowledge, what you will
find is that we are all part of the same, and we should find a way to heal by
uniting in peace”—the conclusion of Gita is exactly the opposite one: since the
                          No Substitute for True Universals                     257


self is not killed and is not killing, engage in a battle and do (your duty of)
killing. It is difficult to resist here the temptation to paraphrase this passage as
the justification of the burning of Jews in the gas chambers to their executor
caught in a moment of doubt: since “he who thinks it to be the killer and he
who thinks it to be killed, both know nothing,” since “the self kills not, and the
self is not killed,” therefore “you ought not to grieve for any” burned Jew, but,
“looking alike on pleasure and pain, on gain and loss, on victory and defeat,” do
what you were ordered to do . . . In this alternative, I of course prefer Buddhism
to Gita, but I do not endorse the Buddhist dismissal of the subject (“self ”) as an
illusion. Yes, the subject is a void (“nothing”), but it is not the same void as the
Buddhist sunyata, the selfless emptiness that grounds entire reality. It is rather
its exact opposite: the absolute contraction to the zero-point of a self-relating
void excluding all otherness, all positive content. We could paraphrase here
Hegel’s axiom that the Absolute should be grasped not only as Substance but
also as Subject: the void is not just the all-encompassing void as the medium of
interrelations that form our reality but also the singular point through which
we maintain a minimal distance towards reality.
   Politically, however, my true target is Gita, while I maintain my highest
respect for Buddhism which is ultimately the only serious alternative to the
Lacanian ethics. While I was often attacked for my stance on Gita, the recent
podcast by Swami Revatikaanta reaches a new low in these attacks. It is not just
the humiliating and patronizing tone of his attack (apparently I speak of things
about which I don’t know anything, and Swami ends with an invitation to
participate in his course to learn more . . .). Swami shows a clip from my
improvised podcast with Piers Morgan8; here is a brief resume of my written
argumentation:

   Christopher Nolan’s film Oppenheimer has angered many Indian movie-
   goers due to the reference of Bhagavad Gita during an intimate scene. Many
   have taken to Twitter, wondering how the censor board cleared the scene. A
   statement from Save Culture Save India Foundation said: “We do not know
   the motivation and logic behind this unnecessary scene on life of a scientist.
   A scene in the movie shows a woman makes a man read Bhagwad Geeta
   aloud while getting over him and doing sexual intercourse.”9 My reaction to
258                             Quantum History


   this reaction is exactly the opposite one: Bhagavad Gita advocates a horrible
   ethics of military slaughter as an act of highest duty, so we should protest
   that a gentle act of passionate love-making is besmirched by a spiritualist
   obscenity. In order to find our way in the ongoing mess, we should do
   something like this: bring out the horror which sustains the “spiritualization”
   of carnal passion.

I am well aware of the provocative nature of this passage, but I continue to
subscribe to it fully. So here is the gist of Swami’s counter-argument:

   Detachment and non-identification do not imply a lack of moral sensibility.
   Instead they encourage individuals to act purely and selflessly without
   selfish ego-driven desires corrupting their actions. This is in essence the
   marriage between Karma Yoga, which means selfless detached action, and
   Dharma, righteous conduct. Now I’ve introduced Dharma, so what is
   Dharma? The Mahabharat which by the way is the wider text to which the
   Bhagavad Gita belongs defines it as the Eternal Duty, the Sanatana Dharma,
   towards All Creatures is the absence of malevolence towards them in
   thought, deed and word, and to practice compassion and charity towards
   them. Now if that is indeed true, why then does Krishna seemingly
   encourage Arjuna to engage in a war and to kill his aggressors? A fair
   question because we must protect that which is worthy of protection or see
   it die. If we value life we must value Dharma. Dharma is that which sustains
   life, which promotes nonviolence and compassion to all. Now if that very
   system comes under attack by those who have no desire to uphold it, then
   our inaction is nothing but complicity in its destruction.10

One should first note that Arjuna (a warrior used to slaughter) despairs
because the war is now the Kurukshetra war between the Pandavas and the
Kauravas, i.e., a battle against his own kin, not against an external enemy.
Swami’s conclusion is that a precise reading of Gita totally disqualifies
Himmler’s reference to Gita since the Nazis were obviously not acting out of
compassion and were not fighting for the protection of the Good and the
destruction of the wicked . . . truly? From the Nazi standpoint, they were doing
precisely this, which is why it is more than easy to imagine Himmler’s
                           No Substitute for True Universals                       259


justification of the Holocaust in Swami’s terms: yes, we must protect that which
is worthy of protection or see it die, and Germany is something that is worthy
of protection; but Germany is under systematic attack by the Jews who threaten
its very existence, so our inaction against the Jews is nothing but complicity in
the destruction of Germany . . .
   So my point is that the fanatical Nazis were far from being motivated by
selfish ego-driven desires: many of them effectively acted out of the conviction
that they are saving their country, a conviction for which they were ready to
die. One must accept the sad and disturbing fact that true radical evil reaches
beyond egotism and can adopt the form of Good.
   Furthermore, note that Swami ignores the key passage in Krishna’s answer
to Arjuna in which there is no mention of compassion and justice—from the
long passage quoted above, it is clear that the argument is purely ontological, it
concerns the two levels of being, the eternal being of the indestructible Self
and the impermanent bodily reality. So it’s not even the prospect of eventual
victory that justifies a military engagement, it is just the empty obligation to do
one’s duty. The conclusion is clear: if the external reality is ultimately just an
ephemeral appearance, then even the most horrifying killing eventually does
not matter. Clarice Lispector concisely formulated the horror of the indifference
that underlies the notion of an all-encompassing god: “What still frightened
me was that even the unpunishable horror would be generously reabsorbed by
the abyss of unending time, by the abyss of unending heights, by the deep abyss
of the God: absorbed into the heart of an indifference. So unlike human
indifference.”11 This horror of indifference is profoundly Christian, while one
often encounters the anti-Christian logic in today’s Russia. Margarita
Simonyan, editor of Russia Today, said in 2022 it was “more probable” Putin
would turn to his nuclear arsenal than admit defeat:

   Either we lose in Ukraine, or the Third World War starts. I think World War
   III is more realistic, knowing us, knowing our leader. This is to my horror on
   one hand. But on the other hand, it is what it is. We will go to heaven, while
   they will simply croak . . . We’re all going to die someday.12

This is Krishna repeating its line in Russia today! Furthermore, it is not only me,
an ignorant European, that rejects the ethics of Gita: in India itself, critical voices
260                               Quantum History


abound. As expected, many Buddhists deny the existence of an eternal
indestructible Self that is one with the Absolute: in Buddhism, there is no such Self,
all that there is beneath the interplay of perishable phenomena is the primordial
Void. Ambedkar wrote that in Gita the caste system is systematically ordained and
explained. Swami is right about that, in reading Gita, one should take into account
its context, which is in this case provided by Hinduism. In Hinduism, “Dharma”
designates an individual’s duty fulfilled by observance of custom or law, and is
clearly defined as specific to a cast to which one belongs: duties are individually
fixed with reference to the qualities arising from their inherent natures:

   The inherently natural duties of a Brahmin are peace, self-restraint, religious
   austerities,   cleanliness,   quietness,    straightforwardness      (humanity),
   knowledge (that is, spiritual knowledge). The inherently natural duty
   (karma) of the Kshatriya is bravery, brilliance, courage, intentness, not
   running away from the battle, generosity, and exercising authority (over
   subject people), “goraksya” (that is, the business of keeping cattle), and
   vanijya (that is, trade) is the inherently natural duty of the Vaishya; and in
   the same way, service is the inherently natural duty of the Shudra.13

Ambedkar concludes that Gita is neither a book of religion nor a book of
philosophy: since the intent behind writing Gita was to defend certain dogmas
of religion on philosophical grounds, it is “a philosophical defense of counter-
revolution.”14 Against Ambedkar, Gandhi proposed a desperate reinterpretation
to avoid this conclusion: he believed that Gita taught the principles of
non-violence, self-control, and selfless action, which he used as the basis for his
philosophy of Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance), so that Gita is far from
justifying war: war is just a metaphor for the inner struggle in a soul between
the Good and the Evil15—clearly a very problematic reading since a metaphor
works both ways: inner struggle can also be an internalization into a psyche of
a real warfare. (This is why today, with the world on the brink of a global war,
the message of Gita is especially dangerous.) And this is why, today more than
ever, the project of contingent universalities that I share with Simoniti provides
the only serious philosophical option to enable us to think how to avoid the
abyss of self-destruction.
                        Variation 3
   Pure voice, Pure sound:
  Beethoven, Globokar, Act


                     Observation and the Act

Quantum mechanics is defined by the tension between the real of wave
oscillations and what we experience as reality: reality arises when the wave
function collapses. In philosophical terms, this collapse is the passage from
pre-ontological real to reality as the topic of ontology, the analysis of “what is,”
what really exists. The mediator between the two levels is an act in the strongest
sense of the word—what kind of act?
   The discourse of ontology is sustained by what John Searle, the philosopher
of speech acts, called an “indirect speech act”: its assertive surface, its stating
that the world “is like that,” conceals a performative dimension, i.e., ontology is
constituted by the misrecognition of how its enunciation brings about its
propositional content. The only way to account for this “magical power” of
declarations is by having recourse to the Lacanian hypotheses of the “big
Other”—Searle himself has a presentiment of it when he points out that “it is
only given such institutions as the church, the law, private property, the state
and a special position of the speaker and hearer within these institutions”1 that
one can accomplish a declaration. In Hans Christian Andersen’s “Emperor’s
New Clothes,” all the world knows that the emperor has no clothes, and
everybody knows that all the world knows it—why, then, does a simple public
statement that “the emperor has no clothes” blow up the entire established


                                                                                261
262                              Quantum History


network of intersubjective relations? In other words: if everybody knew it, who
did not know it? The Lacanian answer is, of course: the big Other (in the sense
of the field of socially recognized knowledge). Declarations imply the same
logic: the meeting is closed when, by means of the utterance, “The meeting is
closed,” this fact comes to the big Other’s knowledge.
   The parallel with quantum collapse becomes clear now: in quantum
mechanics, the “big Other” is the order of our everyday reality, while in
quantum processes phenomena float without being rooted in a “big Other.”
And the “magic” of an observation/registration which affects its object is the
same as that of the constative which functions as a performative. However,
how can a logic which is specific to a symbolic process also structure
phenomena in nature? We stumble here upon the deepest mystery of quantum
physics: in it, nature is in a sense “denaturalized”; we find in it processes which
we thought are specific to the symbolic universe. Collapse thus takes place
neither directly in the measuring machine nor in the conscious observer but in
the “big Other” which guarantees the consistency of our ordinary reality.
   But there is a third problem: where precisely does consciousness enter here?
Is it the space of superpositions as such or does it designate the moment of
collapse, of a choice when, “in a small fraction of a second, it will become one
or the other”? From a Lacano-Schellingian standpoint an immediate counter-
argument imposes itself: but why the identification of (free) decision with
consciousness? Are basic decisions not unconscious? What is missing in
Penrose’s mental space in which there are physical processes and consciousness
is thus simply the Freudian unconscious. This is also why we should abandon
the option that superpositions are unconscious, while consciousness enters at
the moment of decision which causes the collapse of superpositions: decisions
are unconscious, consciousness just takes note of them.
   Recall the case of falling in love: it is never a conscious decision/choice—all
of a sudden, I just become aware that I am deeply in love. Prior to Freud, Schelling
developed the notion that the basic free decisions made by us are unconscious.
So, with regard to Libet’s experiment (which proved that, a split second before
we made a decision to move a finger, our neurons are already sending signals to
our arm), from the Freudian standpoint, the basic underlying problem is that of
the status of the Unconscious: are there only conscious thoughts (my belated
                  Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act              263


conscious decision to move a finger) and “blind” neuronal processes (the
neuronal activity to move the finger), or is there also an unconscious “mental”
process? And, what is the ontological status of this unconscious, if there indeed
is one? Is it not that of a purely virtual symbolic order, of a pure logical
presupposition (the decision had to be made, although it was never effectively
made in real time)? At the apogee of German Idealism, Schelling deployed
the notion of the primordial decision-differentiation (Ent-Scheidung), the
unconscious atemporal deed by means of which the subject chooses his/her
eternal character which, afterwards, within his/her conscious-temporal life, s/he
experiences as the inexorable necessity, “the way s/he always was”:

   The deed, once accomplished, sinks immediately into the unfathomable
   depth, thereby acquiring its lasting character. It is the same with the will
   which, once posited at the beginning and led into the outside, immediately
   has to sink into the unconscious. . . . Once done, the deed is eternally
   done. The decision that is in any way the true beginning should not appear
   before consciousness, it should not be recalled to mind, since this, precisely,
   would amount to its recall. He who, apropos of a decision, reserves for
   himself the right to drag it again to light, will never accomplish the
   beginning.2




        Beethoven: the Reverberations of the Act

To get—not a notion but—an artistic rendering of this Schellingian act of
primordial Decision, an act of pure will that precedes and grounds every
dialectical process, let’s deploy an analysis of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony
although it might seem like an eccentric exercise . . . And let’s begin at the
beginning because in some sense everything is decided at the beginning of its
first movement. A mysterious string tremolando breaks the silence and
introduces a tension of expectation; then the stern motif 1 emerging out of the
tremolando is gathering strength and then strikes with all brutality. What
cannot but strike the eye (or, rather, the ear) of a listener used to the classical
style is the precipitative character of the entrance of motif 1 in all its force: it
264                             Quantum History


happens all at once, it is too hasty—one would expect a slower development
and ascent but we get a nervous self-overtaking.
  To put it bluntly, Beethoven’s music undoubtedly often verges on kitsch—
suffice it to mention the over-repetitive exploitation of the “beautiful” main
motif in the 1st movement of his Violin Concerto, or the rather tasteless
climactic moments of the Leonora 3 overture. How vulgar are the climactic
moments of Leonora 3 (and 2, its even worse utterly boring version) in
comparison with Mozart’s overture to Magic Flute, where Mozart still retains
what one cannot but call a proper sense of musical decency, interrupting the
melodic line before it reaches the full orchestra climactic repetition and,
instead, jumping directly to the final staccatos! Perhaps, Beethoven himself
sensed it, writing another, final, overture, the Op. 72c Fidelio—brief and
concise, sharp, the very opposite of Leonora’s 2 and 3. (The true pearl, however,
is the undeservedly underestimated Leonora 1 Op. 138, whose very date is not
sure—it is Beethoven at his best, with the beautiful rise to a climax without any
embarrassing excesses.) But at the beginning of the Movement 1 of the 9th,
Beethoven surpasses kitsch by way of bringing it to extreme: the climactic
repetition of the motif 1 hits us preemptively with full force. The “dawn of
Creation”? Maybe, but in the sense of Eric Frank Russell’s short science-fiction
story “The Sole Solution”3 which begins with the confused rambling of an old
lone man:

  He brooded in darkness and there was no one else. Not a voice, not a whisper.
  Not the touch of a hand. Not the warmth of another heart. Darkness. Solitude.
  Eternal confinement where all was black and silent and nothing stirred.
  Imprisonment without prior condemnation. Punishment without sin. The
  unbearable that had to be borne unless some mode of escape could be devised.
  No hope of rescue from elsewhere. No sorrow or sympathy or pity in another
  soul, another mind.

The old man then starts to dream about a solution:

  The easiest escape is via the imagination. One hangs in a strait-jacket and
  flees the corporeal trap by adventuring in a dreamland of one’s own. But
  dreams are not enough. They are unreal and all too brief. The freedom to be
                    Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act               265


   gained must be genuine and of long duration. That meant he must make a
   stern reality of dreams, a reality so contrived that it would persist for all time.

After a long hard work of planning all the details, the time comes for the act:

   The time was now. The experiment must begin. Leaning forward, he gazed
   into the dark and said, “Let there be light.” And there was light.

Here we get the ultimate point-de-capiton (“quilting-point”): the last lines
retroactively make it clear that the ramblings are the thoughts of God himself
just prior to the act of creation. The beauty of this final reversal is that it inverts
the standard “twist” the reader expects, in which the thought process of God is
revealed to be nothing more than the delusional rambling of a madman who
thinks he is god . . . For a philosopher, however, as we have already seen, this
denouement is no surprise. The beginning is not at the beginning; this is the
first lesson of Schelling’s Ages of the World fragment in which he focuses
precisely on what goes on before the beginning.
   The beginning of all the beginnings is, of course, the “In the beginning was
the Word” from John; prior to it, there was nothing, that is, the void of divine
eternity. According to Schelling, however, eternity is not a nondescript mass—a
lot of things take place in it. Prior to the Word, there is the chaotic-psychotic
universe of blind drives, their rotary motion, their undifferentiated pulsating;
and the Beginning occurs when the Word is pronounced which represses,
rejects into the eternal Past, this self-enclosed circuit of drives. In short, at the
Beginning proper stands a Resolution, an act of Decision which, by
differentiating between past and present, resolves the preceding unbearable
tension of the rotary motion of drives. The true Beginning is the passage from
the “closed” rotary motion to “open” progress, from drive to desire—or, in
Lacanian terms, from the Real to the Symbolic.4 It is thus the decision,
Ent-Scheidung, primordial Difference (from Old French, from Latin dēcīsiō,
literally: a cutting off).
   So what is the relationship between act and anxiety? The contemporary
doxa designates our age as the “age of anxiety” and, at the same time, as the age
of postmodern reflexivity in which we are permanently bombarded with
choices, with less and less certainties provided by tradition to serve as the
266                             Quantum History


bedrock of our choices. The doxa implies that anxiety is caused by the
deadlock of the pressure to choose (“What should I do? Why do A instead
of non-A?”). However, are these choices really so overwhelming? Are they
rather not the form of appearance of their very opposite, the fundamental
lack of (radical) choices in our “postideological/postpolitical” era. This
points in the direction of Lacan who conceives anxiety as caused by the
overproximity of excessive jouissance, and (the hysterical) acting out is, at its
most basic, an attempt to evacuate the body of jouissance, i.e., to reassert the
symbolic castration and thus open up the space for desire. In contrast to acting
out, the (psychotic) passage a l’acte involves a direct—suicidal—identification
with (or “fall into”) the Real which precludes any possibility for the desire to
emerge.
  As is usual in the sonata form, motif 1 is followed by motif 2 which
announces a “lovely pastoral world,”5 a variation on the “Ode to Joy” melody
from the last movement. The interplay of the two motifs is dazzling: 7 minutes
or so into the movement, motif 1 is rendered in a lyric mode in G minor with
added upper neighbour semitones, i.e., it works as the opposite of its first
climactic appearance in its pure violence; no wonder that, in contrast to this
lyric rendering, motif 2 appears in a more and more brutal mode. One should
mention at least how, due to its eerie background provided by a “mostly
chromatic meandering in the bass,” the funeral march in coda “grows to
terrifying proportions, as a solemn procession for the dead becomes more like
a macabre dance of the dead”6—we get here a typical Hegelian shift of “for” to
“of,” of object to subject, since subject itself gets caught into the movement.7
There is no sonata-form reconciliation at the end of Movement 1: it ends
abruptly as it begins—the final bars repeat a melodic line that could easily
continue. One cannot but agree that

  the first movement of the Ninth represents the interment of the great-man
  military heroism that the earlier symphony celebrates: the funeral march at
  the end of the Ninth’s first movement puts the nail in the coffin of the
  Napoleonic dream, which had curdled so devastatingly and produced the
  political repressions that Beethoven was living and working under when he
  was writing the Ninth Symphony in the early 1820s.8
                  Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act            267


Movement 2 is supposed to render a lively joy, the portrait of a life of
all-encompassing brotherhood, but it does it with a touch of frantic madness—
Stanley Kubrick was right when he used this movement as the music for his
dystopian masterpiece A Clockwork Orange. Similarly, Movement 3 renders
peaceful pleasure, but with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy—it renders the
dream of a world as it was before the traumatic act of decision that hits us in
Movement 1. And this brings us to the notorious Movement 4 which deceptively
poses as the synthetic unity and collective evolution of the preceding three
movements: at its start, the main motif of each is briefly recalled by the cellos
and basses in their recitative-like outbursts, the idea being that the music from
the previous three movements is unfit for the grander purpose of the finale—
after the motifs from the first three movements are repeated, the bass solo sings
Beethoven’s own words: “O Friends, not these sounds!”
   Some optimist-spiritualist interpreters see in this movement nothing less
that the disclosure of the “Meaning of life”—they read the notorious “Ode to
Joy” (recall that its melodic line is the official anthem of the European Union!),
as the first moment of a triad: the “Ode to Joy” renders the earthly brotherhood,
brotherhood of men (it involves a strictly masculine standpoint: a moment of
happiness includes “whoever has created an abiding friendship, or has won a
true and loving wife,” but nothing whatsoever is said about the happiness of
wives themselves); then we pass into a “deeper” spiritual level, a call to all
brothers to “be embraced, millions” in looking up to the heavenly god—“there
must be a loving father” (in Grosse Fuge Beethoven seemed to understand that
there is no such father); the complex double fugue which concludes the triad
stages an intermixture of the two dimensions which should somehow render
the meaning of our lives—an earthly brotherhood grounded in the awareness
of a heavenly loving father that protects us.9
   It is not only that the Movement doesn’t end here—a careful listener can
easily discover that something is missing in this recapitulation: “Ode to Joy”
really ends a little bit after 9 minutes when a prolonged weird silence is
interrupted by a vulgar “Turkish March”-style music which belies the
brotherhood—some critics even designate the beginning of this “Turkish
March” passage as the “fart” in the finale: “Roger Norrington’s description of
the intervention of the contrabassoon, two bassoons, and bass drum, in the
268                              Quantum History


wrong key, in a new speed, and in what you soon realize is the wrong beat of
the bar, a bathetic moment that comes just after the choir have invoked a vision
of God with some of the powerfully revelatory music of the symphony.”10
   So yes, all brothers are embraced, “but those who cannot must creep tearfully
away from our circle”—what if they are referred to not so much in words as in
the vulgar music which accompanies them? The words are: “Gladly, as His suns
fly through the heavens’ grand plan, go on, brothers, your way, joyful, like a hero
to victory.” But the spell is already broken, and when, after this rather creepy
intermezzo the “Ode to Joy” melody is repeated, it is too late to cover up the
crack. Then, as if taking cognizance of the fact that the spell of brotherhood is
broken and that only a higher transcendent agency can restore order, “Be
embraced millions” enters, enacting a move to god who must be—“Brothers,
above the starry canopy there must dwell a loving Father.” Here, critics have
argued that Beethoven recalls the liturgical hymns of medieval sacred music:

   The religious questions are musically characterized by archaistic moments,
   veritable “Gregorian fossils” inserted in a “quasi-liturgical” structure based
   on the sequence first versicle—response—second versicle—response—
   hymn. Beethoven’s employment of this sacred music style has the effect of
   attenuating the interrogative nature of the text when it mentioned the
   prostration to the supreme being.11

And then we get the double fugue as enforced reconciliation; what follows the
fugue is a fake, a hysterical mess which lasts to the end of the movement. The
true double fugue is Beethoven’s quartet movement Grosse Fuge op. 133
which—I agree with Daniel Chua—“speaks of failure, the very opposite of the
triumphant synthesis associated with Beethovenian recapitulations.”12 So, to
recapitulate the advance of the entire symphony, the only moment of truth is
rendered in the First Movement, and the other three enact the three modes of
a fantasmatic escape: hysterically-joyful violence (which is literally the truth of
joyful brotherhood); escape into romantic nostalgia; pathetic failure of the
“Ode to Joy.”
   Beethoven’s limitation is not just ideologico-political, it is strictly formal:
his music still functions in the expressive mode, rendering a series of ideological
and libidinal stances—it didn’t yet inscribe these stances into the musical form
                   Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act                 269


itself. This inscription happens only with atonality—even Beethoven’s Grosse
Fuge remains within the confines of pre-modern music as an act of supplication:
a call to a figure of the big Other (beloved Lady, King, God . . .) to respond, not
as the symbolic big Other, but in the Real of his or her being (breaking his own
rules by showing mercy; conferring her contingent love on us . . .). Music is
thus an attempt to provoke the “answer of the Real”: to give rise in the Other to
the “miracle” of which Lacan speaks apropos of love, the miracle of the Other
stretching back his or her hand to me. The historical changes in the status of
“big Other” (grosso modo, in what Hegel referred to as “objective Spirit”) thus
directly concern music—perhaps, musical modernity designates the moment
when music renounces the endeavour to provoke the answer of the Other:
there is no one to turn to, to address, to bear witness TO, no one to receive our
plea or lament. This position is extremely difficult to sustain: in modern music,
Webern was the first who was able to sustain this inexistence of the Other:
even Schoenberg was still composing for a future ideal listener, while Webern
accepted that there is NO “proper” listener. Vinko Globokar, a Slovene
composer who worked mostly in France and Germany, belongs to this line: his
music is profoundly materialist—in what sense?



           Globokar: From Pure Sound to Social
                      Antagonisms

It seems that the development of all great artists proceeds in two main stages:
first, the radicalization of the initial project; then the dialectical reversal into its
opposite. Globokar’s development is also marked by two stages: he started with
the full assertion of the musical material in its autonomy—therein resides the
point of Globokar’s resuscitaton of the unique practice of simultaneous
breathing and playing (inhaling and exhaling) the oboe, so that the sound can
go on for over a minute: “When one is compelled to listen to one tone for a
long time,one all of a sudden begins to hear unimagined things.” What we get
here is a kind of musical counterpart to anamorphosis in painting or to the
extended shots in Tarkovsky. What pervades Tarkovsky’s films is the heavy
gravity of Earth, which seems to exert its pressure on time itself, generating an
270                              Quantum History


effect of temporal anamorphosis, extending the dragging of time well beyond
what we perceive as justified by the requirements of narrative movement (one
should confer here on the term “Earth” all the resonance it acquired in late
Heidegger)—perhaps, Tarkovsky is the clearest example of what Deleuze
called the time-image replacing the movement-image.
                                       *
This protracted time is neither the symbolic time of the diegetic space nor the
time of the reality of our (spectator’s) viewing the film, but an intermediate
domain whose visual equivalent are perhaps the protracted stains which “are”
the yellow sky in late van Gogh or the water or grass in Munch: this uncanny
“massiveness” pertains neither to the direct materiality of the colour stains nor
to the materiality of the depicted objects—it dwells in a kind of intermediate
spectral domain of what Schelling called geistige Koerperlichkeit, the spiritual
corporeality. This dimension emerged for the first time in Romantic music
which occupied itself with “a sonority that is not only unrealizable but
unimaginable.” Charles Rosen, who wrote this line, quotes a passage from
“Abegg” variations, Schumann’s opus 1, in which the impossibility arises

   because Schumann is thinking of the motto in terms of almost pure sound,
   in terms of release and attack as well as of pitch and rhythm . . . : a note can
   be attacked twice, but a double release without a second attack is nonsense
   on the piano.13

The best-known case, however, is that of Carnaval: its 21 sections intertwine in
multiple ways, each of them a kind of “variation” on others, related to others
through melodic or rhythmic echoes, repetitions and contrasts. In classical
variations, we first get the theme “as such,” followed by the multitude of its
variations: as one would expect in Schumann, the “theme” is simply lacking.
However, in Carnaval, these “variations” do not all possess equal weight: the eighth
section (“Replique”) is followed by “Sphinxes,” a section which is merely written
and cannot be performed. What are these mysterious “sphinxes”? The subtitle of
Carnaval is “miniature scenes on four notes” [scenes mignonnes sur quatre notes],
and “Sphinxes” provide these four notes, the musical cipher of jouissance which
condenses a series of mnemonic associations: the young pianist Ernestine von
Fricken, Schumann’s girlfriend at the time he composed Carnaval, came from the
                   Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act               271


Bohemian town of Asch, a name whose four letters are identical with the only
letters of the word “Schumann” which have note equivalents in German musical
terminology (where “H” stands for B, and “B” for B flat). Furthermore, if we read
“As” as A flat, we get another variant of the musical cipher, so that we obtain three
brief series: SCHumAnn (E flat—C—B—A); ASCH (read as: A flat—C—B);
ASCH (read as: A—E flat—C—B). In his Psychanalyser, Serge Leclaire reports on
a psychoanalytic treatment which produced the cipher of enjoyment in his
patient: the enigmatic term “poord’jeli,” a condensation of a multitude of
mnemonic traces (the patient’s love for a girl Lili, a reference to licorne, etc.). Do
we not encounter something of the same order in Schumann’s “Sphinxes”?14
   The entire piece thus turns around “Sphinxes” as its absent, impossible-real
point of reference: a series of bare notes without any measure or harmony—to
put it in Kantian terms, they are not musically “schematized,” and therefore
cannot be effectively performed. “Sphinxes” are a formula of enjoyment, not
unlike Freud’s formula of trimethylamin, which appears at the end of the dream
of Irma’s injection. As such, the absence of “Sphinxes” is structural: if “Sphinxes”
were to be effectively performed, the fragile consistency of the entire piece
would fall apart. (In some recordings, “Sphinxes” is effectively performed: less
than half a minute of a dozen protracted tones. The effect is properly uncanny,
as if we had stepped “through the looking-glass” and entered some forbidden
domain, beyond (or, rather, beneath) the fantasmatic frame—or, more properly,
as if we had caught sight of some entity outside of its proper element, like seeing
a dead squid on a table, no longer alive and moving gracefully through the
water. For this reason, the uncanny mystery of these notes can all of a sudden
change into vulgarity, obscenity even—it is no wonder that the most outstanding
proponent of performing “Sphinxes” was none other than Rachmaninov, one
of the exemplary kitsch authors of serious music.)
   Back to Globokar: then, from the mid-1970s, Globokar became aware of how
this immersion into the autonomy of pure sound is a deadlock, a kind of musical
hard-core pornography. Thus, he returned to the socio-ideological context of
music, which affects from within the process of composing itself: “Music is for
me always a consequence. Its emergence is based on an idea, a question, a care,
on a problem or something taking place which at the beginning finds itself
outside music. Ethics thus determines aesthetics, at the beginning at least.”15 The
272                              Quantum History


term “consquence” is crucial here, and has to be given the whole weight of what
Alain Badiou called “fidelity” (to a truth-event): the proper domain of an artist’s
work is that of their fidelity to an ethical encounter or decision.
   This return to the social dimension is not external to the musical material,
but inscribed into its very network of formal relations. In an interview with
Armin Koehler apropos “Masse, Macht und Individuum,” Globokar pointed
out how the constellation of these three terms is directly reflected in the three
groups of musicians that perform the piece: a group of 21 who communicate
one with another in a non-organized way (the “crowd”); the orchestra of
70 performing in a hierarchical order, under the control of a conductor
(“power”); four soloists who interact and are not simply “individuals,” since
their interaction forms the germ of a new collective. And, as Globokar asserts,
there is a fourth element present, electronic organs whose sound stands for the
continuity of indestructible Life. Today, this “pure life” has a precise political
equivalent in the figure of homo sacer, those who are excluded from the
political symbolic order and reduced to bare life. In a debate about the fate of
Guantanamo prisoners on NBC, one of the arguments for the ethical and legal
acceptability of their status was that “they are those who were missed by the
bombs”: since they were the target of the US bombing and accidentally
survived it, and since this bombing was part of a legitimate military operation,
one cannot condemn their fate when they were taken prisoners after the
combat—whatever their situation, it is better, less severe, than being dead . . .
   This reasoning tells us much more than it intends: it puts the prisoner
almost literally into the position of the living dead, those who are in a way
already dead (their right to live forfeited by being legitimate targets of
murderous bombings), so that they are now cases of what Agamben calls homo
sacer, the one who can be killed with impunity since, in the eyes of the law, his
life no longer counts. (There is a vague similarity between their situation and
the—legally problematic—premise of the movie Double Jeopardy: if you were
condemned for killing A and you later, after serving your term and being
released, discover that A is still alive, you can now kill him with impunity since
you cannot be condemned two times for the same act. In psychoanalytic terms,
this killing would clearly display the temporal structure of masochist
perversion: the order of events is inverted, you are first punished and thus gain
                   Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act              273


the right to commit the crime.) If the Guantanamo prisoners are located in the
space “between the two deaths,” occupying the position of homo sacer, legally
dead (deprived of a determinate legal status) while biologically still alive, the
US authorities which treat them in this way are also in a kind of in-between
legal status which forms the counterpart to homo sacer: acting as a legal power,
their acts are no longer covered and constrained by the law—they operate in
an empty space that is still within the domain of the law.
   What Globokar is proposing is thus not a new variation on the old boring
opposition of individual and crowd, of the individuum “oppressed” by the
crowd, etc., but the matrix of four modalities of being-together, of sociality,
which determine today’s life: the disorganized multitude (of, say, consumers
or participants of a market-exchange); the crowd controlled by a Leader;
the concentration of individuals reduced to bare life, to objects of social
administration (exemplarily, in a concentration camp); and, finally, the
possibility of a new authentic collective.
   Consequently, if we are not to miss what Globokar is giving us, the first
thing to do is to reject one of today’s critical topoi, the allegedly “proto-Fascist”
character of the mass choreography displaying disciplined movements of
thousands of bodies (parades, mass performances on the stadiums, etc.); if one
finds it also in Socialism, one immediately draws the conclusion about a
“deeper solidarity” between the two “totalitarianisms.” Such a procedure, the
very prototype of ideological liberalism, misses the point: not only are such
mass performances not inherently Fascist; they are not even “neutral,” waiting
to be appropriated by Left or Right—it was Nazism who stole them and
appropriated them from the workers’ movement, their original site of birth.
None of the “proto-Fascist” elements is per se Fascist, what makes them
“Fascist” is only their specific articulation—or, to put it in Stephen Jay Gould’s
terms, all these elements are “ex-apted” by Fascism. In other words, there is no
“Fascism avant la lettre,” because it is the letter itself (the nomination) which
makes, out of the bundle of constitutive elements, Fascism proper.
   Along the same lines, one should radically reject the notion that discipline
(from self-control to bodily training) is a “proto-Fascist” feature—the very
predicate “proto-Fascist” should be abandoned: it is the exemplary case of a
pseudo-concept whose function is to block conceptual analysis. When we say
274                               Quantum History


that the organized spectacle of thousands of bodies (or, say, the admiration of
sports which demand high effort and self-control like mountain climbing) is
“proto-Fascist,” we say strictly nothing, we just express a vague association
which masks our ignorance. So when, decades ago, Kung Fu films were popular
(Bruce Lee, etc.), was it not obvious that we were dealing with a genuine
working-class ideology of youngsters whose sole outlet to success was the
disciplined training of their only possession, their bodies? Spontaneity and the
“let it go” attitude of indulging in excessive freedoms belong to those who have
the means to afford it—those who have nothing have only their discipline. The
“bad” bodily discipline, if there is one, is not the collective training, but, rather,
jogging and body-building as part of the New Age myth of the realization of the
Self ’s inner potentials—no wonder that the obsession with one’s body is an
almost obligatory part of the passage of ex-Leftist radicals into the “maturity” of
pragmatic politics: from Jane Fonda to Joschka Fischer, the “period of latency”
between the two phases was marked by the focus on one’s own body.
                                     *
Alain Badiou wrote in the fourteenth of his “Fifteen Theses on Contemporary
Art”: “Since it is sure of its ability to control the entire domain of the visible and
the audible via the laws governing commercial circulation and democratic
communication, Empire no longer censures anything. All art, and all thought, is
ruined when we accept this permission to consume, to communicate and to
enjoy. We should become pitiless censors of ourselves.”16 And, effectively, today,
we seem to be at the opposite point of the ideology of the 1960s: the mottos of
spontaneity, creative self-expression, etc., are taken over by the System, i.e., the
old logic of the system reproducing itself through repressing and rigidly
channeling the subject’s spontaneous impetuses is left behind. Non-alienated
spontaneity, self-expression, self-realization, they all directly serve the system,
which is why pitiless self-censorship is a sine qua non of emancipatory politics.
Especially in the domain of poetic art, this means that one should totally reject
any attitude of self-expression, of displaying innermost emotional turmoil,
desires, dreams. True art has nothing whatsoever to do with this kind of
disgusting emotional exhibitionism—insofar as the standard notion of “poetic
spirit” is the ability to display one’s intimate turmoil, what Mayakovski said about
himself with regard to his turn from personal poetry to political propaganda in
                   Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act                 275


verses (“I had to step on the throat of my Muse”) is the constitutive gesture of a
true poet. If there is a thing that provokes disgust in a true poet, it is the scene
when a close friend opens up his heart, spilling out all the dirt of his inner life.
Consequently, one should totally reject the standard opposition of “objective”
science focused on reality and “subjective” art focused on emotional reaction to
it and self-expression: if anything, true art is MORE non-subjective than science.
In science, I remain a person with my pathological feature, I just assert objectivity
outside it, while in true art, the artist has to undergo a radical self-objectivization,
he has to die in and for himself, turn into a kind of living dead.
   Furthermore, one should bear in mind that Globokar is deploying these
ethico-political dimensions not as a theoretical exercise, but as a project directly
embodied in the organization of musical material. How, then, are we to detect
traces of the social in the musical material? Perhaps, the privileged way is
through the structural absences in the vocal texture. In Schumann’s
“Humoresque,” we have, in the written score, the famous “inner voice” [innere
Stimme], a third line between the two piano lines, higher and lower. This absent
line is to be reconstructed on the basis of the fact that the first and third levels
(the right and the left hand piano lines) do not relate to each other directly, i.e.,
their relationship is not that of an immediate mirroring: in order to account for
their interconnection, one is thus compelled to (re)construct a third, “virtual”
intermediate level (melodic line) which, for structural reasons, cannot be
played. Schumann brings this procedure of absent melody to an apparently
absurd self-reference when, later in the same fragment of “Humoresque,” he
repeats the same two effectively played melodic lines, yet this time the score
contains no third absent melodic line, no inner voice—what is absent here is
the absent melody, i.e., absence itself. How are we to play these notes when, at
the level of what is effectively to be played, they exactly repeat the previous
notes? The effectively played notes are deprived only of what is not there, of
their constitutive lack, or, to paraphrase the Bible, they lose even that which
they never had. A true pianist should thus have the savoir-faire to play the
existing, positive, notes in such a way that one would be able to discern the
echo of the accompanying non-played “silent” virtual notes or their absence . . .
and is this not how ideology works? The explicit ideological text (or practice) is
sustained by the “unplayed” series of obscene superegotistic supplement.
276                              Quantum History


   In Really Existing Socialism, the explicit ideology of socialist democracy
was sustained by a set of implicit (unspoken) obscene injunctions and
prohibitions, teaching the subject how not to take some explicit norms
seriously and how to implement a set of publicly unacknowledged prohibitions.
One of the strategies of dissidents in the final years of Socialism was therefore
precisely to take the ruling ideology more seriously than it took itself by way
of ignoring its virtual unwritten shadow: “You want us to practice socialist
democracy? OK, here you have it!” And when the Party apparatchiks responded
with desperately trying to hint that this was not the way things worked, one
simply had to ignore these hints . . .
   This is what acheronta movebo (moving the underground) as a practice of
the critique of ideology means: not directly changing the explicit text of the
Law, but, rather, intervening into its obscene virtual supplement. For example,
the relationship towards homosexuality in a soldiers’ community operates at
two distinct levels: the explicit homosexuality is brutally attacked, those
identified as gays are ostracized, beaten up every night, etc.; however, this
explicit homophobia is accompanied by an excessive set of implicit web of
homosexual innuendos, inner jokes, obscene practices, etc. The truly radical
intervention into military homophobia should therefore not focus primarily
on the explicit repression of homosexuality; it should rather “move the
underground,” disturb the implicit homosexual practices which sustain the
explicit homophobia.
   And, to conclude, this insight into the obscenity of the voice enables us to
grasp how the two steps in Globokar’s development (the assertion of the
autonomy of the voice; the move towards the ethico-political dimension) are
deeply co-dependent: the ultimate medium of social control and discipline is
the pure voice itself. It is sufficient to cast a cursory glance at the history of
music—it reads as a kind of counter-history to the usual story of Western
metaphysics as the domination of voice over writing. What we encounter in it
again and again is a voice that threatens the established Order and that, for that
reason, has to be brought under control, subordinated to the rational
articulation of spoken and written word, fixed into writing. In order to
designate the danger that lurks here, Lacan coined the neologism jouis-sense,
enjoyment-in-meaning—the moment at which the singing voice cuts loose
                   Pure Voice, Pure Sound: Beethoven, Globokar, Act               277


from its anchoring in meaning and accelerates into a consuming self-
enjoyment. The oldest musical text in all human history, an edict of a Chinese
emperor, warns against singing which does not follow rules. In his Republic,
Plato claims that, once non-regulated singing is allowed, the entire social
structure will disintegrate and man will return to beast. In medieval times,
Popes warned against free singing which is not subordinated to words as the
devil’s temptation. The French Revolution rejected the effeminated castrato
coloraturas. Stalin prohibited Shostakovich’s “Lady Macbeth” because of the
wild obscene display of sounds. In the 1960s, both Soviet Communists and the
US conservatives perceived Elvis Presley as a threat to our civilization . . .
   The problem is thus always the same: how are we to prevent the voice from
sliding into a consuming self-enjoyment that “effeminates” the reliable
masculine Word? The voice functions here as a “supplement” in the Derridean
sense: one endeavours to restrain it, to regulate it, to subordinate it to the
articulated Word, yet one cannot dispense with it altogether, since a proper
dosage is vital for the exercise of power (suffice it to recall the role of patriotic-
military songs in the building-up of a totalitarian community). However, this
brief description of ours can give rise to the wrong impression that we are
dealing with a simple opposition between the “repressive” articulated Word
and the “transgressive” consuming voice: on the one hand, the articulated
Word that disciplines and regulates the voice as a means of asserting social
discipline and authority, on the other hand, the self-enjoying Voice which acts
as the medium of liberation, of tearing apart the disciplinary chains of law
and order . . . But what about the US Marine Corps’ mesmeric “marching
chants”—are their debilitating rhythm and sadistically sexualized nonsensical
content not an exemplary case of the consuming self-enjoyment in the service
of Power? The excess of the voice is thus radically undecidable—and it is in
this terrain that a composer has to fight his ethical struggle, as Globokar does.
278
                       Variation 4
        Acts of reconciliation


If Hegel is the philosopher of reconciliation par excellence, how can we
reconcile our desperate reading of Hegel with his topic of reconciliation? Let’s
begin with Hegel’s pages on Beautiful Soul and the “hard heart” in his
Phenomenology1 which reverberate today as an uncanny in-advance-critique
of Cancel Culture and other forms of stiff moralism—just recall his claim that
the moral judgment is “envy which helps itself to the cloak of morality.”(361)
Reconciliation is only achieved when the judging “hard heart” itself admits its
complicity in what it condemns—but how, exactly, does this happen? “The
wounds of the spirit heal and leave no scars behind; it is not the deed which is
imperishable, but rather the deed is repossessed by spirit into itself ”(361):
reconciliation “bestows recognition as good on what thought had determined
acting to be, namely, evil.”(362) (The question that remains here is, of course,
how horrors like the Holocaust, gulags, or colonization can be “repossessed by
spirit” . . .) This bestowing of recognition on the other is the obverse of fully
assuming one’s own evil and hypocrisy: the judging consciousness

  is hypocrisy because it pretends that such judgment is not only another
  manner of being evil but is rather itself the rightful consciousness of action. In
  his non-actuality and in the vanity he has in being such a faultfinder, it places
  himself far above the deeds it excoriates, and it wants to know that its speech,
  which is utterly devoid of any deeds, is to be taken as a superior actuality.
                                                                              (359)

The judging consciousness is thus a figure of clear conscience, and, as Steven
Wright said: “A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.” Or, as

                                                                                  279
280                                Quantum History


Hegel puts it concisely, the true Evil is the gaze which sees evil everywhere
around itself. Crucial to this formulation is a conception of language as the
medium of truth, not just an expression of inner intention: the judging
consciousness speaks the truth, it advocates universality, but (in Wittgenstein’s
sense) it displays the opposite attitude of non-forgiveness, of elevating its
singularity above others:

   the hard heart does not recognize the contradiction it commits when it
   does not let the discarding that took place in speech be the true discarding,
   whereas it itself has the certainty of its spirit not in an actual action but in
   its innerness and has its existence in the speech in which its judgment is
   phrased. It is therefore just the hard heart itself which is putting obstacles in
   the way of the other’s return from the deed into the spiritual existence of
   speech and into the equality of spirit, and through its hardness of heart, it
   engenders the inequality which is still present.
                                                                              (360)

And one has to go to the end here: the supreme figure of Evil is therefore god
himself insofar as he stands above creation, judging us—this is why the true
reconciliation happens only in Christianity which enacts the infinite judgment
“god is a mortal man,” an absolute contradiction:

   Absolute spirit comes into existence only at the point where its pure
   knowing of itself is the opposition and flux of itself with itself. Knowing that
   its pure knowing is the abstract essence, it is this duty knowingly in absolute
   opposition to the knowing that knows itself, as the absolute singular
   individuality of the self, as the essence. The former is the pure continuity of
   the universal which knows singular individuality knowing itself as the
   essence as nullity in itself, as evil.
                                                                              (362)

What does this imply in practical terms, as critics of philosophy like to say?
Towards the end of A River Runs Through It (Robert Redford, 1992), Rev.
Maclean gives a sermon about being unable to help loved ones who are
destroying themselves and will not accept help: all that those who truly care for
such a self-destructive person can do is to give unconditional love, even
                                Acts of Reconciliation                        281


without understanding why.2 This is the Christian stance at its purest: not the
promise of salvation but just such unconditional love whose message is: “I
know you are bent on destroying yourself, I know I cannot prevent it, but
without understanding why I love you unconditionally, without any constraint.”
Do these lines not evoke the enigmatic scene in Gethsemane from Matthew
where Jesus tells his disciples who lay tired around him: “I am deeply grieved,
even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.” (Matthew 36-38)?
   Liza Thompson pointed out that Jesus is here “asking for solidarity. Not
followers or crowds to listen to his teachings but an act of togetherness. And it
comes from a place of such radical vulnerability that it disrupts notions of
Jesus as some kind of hierarchical leader.”3 Jesus himself is here on the path to
his self-destruction (knowing next day he will die in terrible pain), and the
only thing he asks his followers is to give him their unconditional love, even
without understanding why. When we curse our fate in despair, when we
courageously accept that no higher force will help us, Christ is here with us—
and this is reconciliation at its most radical.
   However, such a reconciliation can take different forms. Let’s begin with a
well-known case of operatic reconciliation. In the third act of Wagner’s
Tannheuser, the hero is on a pilgrimage in Rome where he approaches “him,
through whom God speaks” (the Pope) and tells his story. However, rather
than finding absolution, he is cursed and told by the pope: “As this staff in my
hand, no more shall bear fresh leaves, from the hot fires of hell, salvation never
shall bloom for thee.” Desperate Tannhauser returns home and dies, but after
his death the growing light bathes the scene as a group of younger pilgrims
arrive bearing the pope’s staff sprouting new leaves, and proclaiming a miracle:
“Hail!, Hail! To this miracle of grace, Hail!”—Tannhauser is posthumously
pardoned . . . Is this a true reconciliation?
   Alain Badiou was right when, against Adorno, he pointed out that there is
no true peace of reconciliation at the end of Tannheuser: the traumatic impact
of Tannhauser’s Rome narrative is far too strong to allow any peaceful resolve
of its unbearable tension. (And, incidentally, the same goes for The Twilight Of
Gods where the brutality of Siegfried’s death and funeral march is not really
appeased by Brunhilde’s immolation.) The reconciliation that concludes the
opera is purely formal, an effect of beautiful music. How could this happen?
282                             Quantum History


Let’s begin by recounting how Tannhauser explains to Venus what he misses in
Venusberg—not spirit but peaceful nature:

  Days, moons—mean nothing to me anymore, for I no longer see the sun,
  nor the friendly stars of heaven; I see no more the blades of grass, which,
  turning freshly green, bring the new summer in; the nightingale that
  foretells me the spring, I hear no more. Shall I never hear it, never behold it
  more?

In the spirit that characterizes German Romanticism, nature and spirituality
go together, so the choice facing the hero is not one between sensual reality
or spirituality but both together against the excess of jouissance. The true
opposition is thus the one between spiritualized nature and excessive jouissance,
where Venus does not stand simply for this excess but is immanently split into
two. When the pious Wolfram sings praises to the evening star (“Oh du mein
holder Abendstern”), we should not ignore the obvious fact that he is singing
praise to Venus: Venus is the morning star and the evening star, i.e., a figure
which belongs to the same series as the Sumerian goddess Inanna:

  The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as
  Inanna’s dual nature. Unlike any other deity, Inanna is able to descend into
  the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to
  make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the
  East.4

Is this not yet another argument that Venus and Elisabeth are one and the
same person? That’s why the same singer should sing both—even more, Venus
and Elisabeth are not just the two sides of the same woman, they are the two
projections of the hero himself onto the object of his love—the woman is here
quite literally Tannhauser’s symptom.
  A hugely significant step towards the right reading of the opera was made
by Romeo Castellucci in his ground-breaking 2017 staging of Tannhauser in
the Bavarian State Opera. The first scene takes place in Venusberg, the site of
carnal pleasures from which Tannhauser wants to escape; Venusberg is
presented as an ugly mound full of disgusting, vaguely feminine creatures,
with thick fat hanging from their bodies and intermixing into a field of flab
                                Acts of Reconciliation                           283


shaking like cellulitis—an image of suffocating decay, boredom, and satiation.
Tannhauser’s first words in the opera, resisting the calls of Venus to stay with
her, are: “Zu viel! Zu viel!” (“Too much! Too much!”). But this is not all: above
this sleazy seething of life hangs a circular ball (a fantasy frame) in the air
within which the idealized version of these same creatures (Venus and her
companions) appears, this time as slim ethereal creatures floating in the air
and gently dancing, deprived of their gross carnality.
   One cannot but recall here the well-known scene from Terry Gilliam’s Brasil
in which, in a high-class restaurant, the waiter recommends to his customers
the best offers from the daily menu (“Today, our tournedo is really special!”,
etc.), yet what the customers get on making their choice is a dazzling colour
photo of the meal on a stand above the plate, and on the plate itself, a loathsome
excremental paste-like lump: we get the split between the image of the food
and the real of its formless excremental remainder, i.e., between the ghost-like
substanceless appearance and the raw stuff of the realm, exactly in the same
way as in Castellucci’s Tannhauser, we get the split between the disgusting real
of the flesh and the dematerialized image.
   We should emphasize here that there is nothing “authentic” in the experience
of this split: it doesn’t render visible the disgusting reality of sex, it just bears
witness to Tannhauser’s psychotic split between the Real and the Imaginary
which takes place when the third term, the Symbolic, is foreclosed. In other
words, the shaking blob is not the Real of sex supplemented by the fantasy of
ethereal girls dancing: fantasy is not only the ethereal vision of dancing slim
girls but also the image of the disgusting quaking jelly whose function is to
obfuscate the fact that sex is always-already “barred,” thwarted by a constitutive
impossibility.
   So how does Elisabeth redeem Tannhauser? Does she kill herself? But this
is a mortal sin . . . The opera remains a mess—towards the end of his life
Wagner himself remarked that he still owes his public a Tannhauser.5 Jon
Vickers canceled a performance of Tannhauser because he disagreed with its
religious stance and considered it blasphemous: as a Christian he believed that
Tannhauser’s redemption should not come about through the love of a woman
but through god himself.6 (Incidentally, there is much more profanity in
Parsifal in spite of its Christian aura.)
284                             Quantum History


   The only solution is the one offered by Istvan Szabo in his Meeting Venus, a
wonderful movie about a staging of Tannhauser in Paris immediately after the
fall of the Wall. The conductor (Niels Arestrup) is from Hungary, the diva
(Glenn Close) is a temperamental superstar from Sweden, the baritone is a
rotund East German who thinks mostly about obtaining hard currency to use
in his auto-painting business, and then there are, of course, the musicians, the
members of the chorus, the stagehands and electricians and painters and
property masters, all members of unions that are ferociously protective of their
contracts—a union man refuses to press the button to raise the curtain just
before the premiere since he would thereby violate a trade union rule, and it
looks like the performance will have to be canceled. But the diva proposes a
simple solution: they should perform the entire opera in front of the closed
curtain, directly addressing the public. The performance is a triumph, and
while the camera shows the conductor during the last tones of the music, we
see in reality the repeated miracle: the conductor’s dry wooden stick sprouting
fresh green leaves . . .
   The true miracle is the spirit of community established by this performance:
all their petty conflicts and sexual tensions are forgotten, we pass from eros to
agape. The supreme irony is that some idiots read the film as an anti-workers
manifesto: art (spirituality) wins over class struggle (trade union defense of
workers’ rights), but the truth is rather the opposite—the spirit of Communist
solidarity wins over petty trade-unionist conflicts of interests.
   Two details deserve especially to be noted about the finale. First, while
everybody is in a panic at the prospect that the performance will have to be
canceled, it is the diva who proposes the solution that leads to triumph, and
her beatific, benevolent smile of satisfaction dominates the final moments
when all others are caught in the enthusiasm of full triumph. Her gaze is
directed at the conductor with whom she had a passionate love affair that
ended in a fiasco during rehearsals—the way she looks at him at the end
signals a profound reconciliation. Their exclusive love affair ascends to a higher
level, the tumultuous eros (which has to end in failure since il n’y a pas de
rapport sexuel) is transformed into the peace of agape. Second, the miracle
(the wooden stick sprouting fresh leaves) is repeated: first just staged as a part
of the story, then as an event in reality, and it is this repetition of miracle in
                               Acts of Reconciliation                         285


reality that works as an authentic shock bringing us, the viewers, to the edge of
tears . . .
   Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly), the same reconciliation through
music, through the musical form, is at work in one of Rammstein’s supreme
songs, “Mutter.” The lyrics tell the story of a child not born from a womb but in
an experiment, thus having no true father or mother; they describe his plan to
kill both the mother “who never gave birth to him” and then himself. However,
he fails to kill himself, instead ending up mutilated and no better off than
before. The child begs and prays for strength, but his dead mother does not
answer—here are the lyrics of the first strophe:

   The tears of a crowd of very old children / I string them on a white hair / I
   throw the wet chain into the air / and wish that I had a mother

Looking closer, one discovers that the situation of the child is ambiguous: was
it an experimental birth out of the womb, an abortion so that he sings from the
dead, or, at a more general level, is it a metaphor for the situation of Germans
after World War II where they found their “motherland” destroyed and thus
their lives ruined? One should resist here the temptation to decide what the
song “really is about”—it “really is about” the formal constellation of a
motherless child who survives his suicide. And a similar ambiguity is
surprisingly at work in different musical versions of the song: there is the
Rammstein hard rock “original,” but then there are versions for solo soprano
accompanied by piano or symphonic orchestra, for male chorus, even for
children’s chorus (with lyrics in Russian), and they all sound so “natural” in
spite of the extreme brutality of the event described in the lyrics.7 One should
definitely not interpret this last version as a display of extreme irony—no, the
singing children enact the only possible reconciliation of the desperate
predicament of the song’s hero, so they are to be taken in all naïvety.
   The point is again that what Hegel calls “reconciliation” is not a reduction of
the traumatic excess to a gapless totality but the acceptance of this excess in
its meaningless brutality. Such a notion of reconciliation enables us to
identify immediately false reconciliations or false solutions like the one that
concludes Conclave (2024, directed by Edward Berger), a movie which clearly
demonstrates the ambiguous role of the topic of trans rights in political
286                             Quantum History


processes. Cardinal Lawrence (superbly played by Ralph Fiennes) is tasked
with coordinating the selection of a new Pope, and finds himself at the centre
of the political struggles that divide the Church: there is a Black cardinal who
was involved in a sexual scandal, a European conservative cardinal advocating
the return to Latin masses and a tougher stance against Islam, a corrupted
American liberal cardinal, etc., and their conflict threatens to shake the very
foundations of the Catholic Church. The tension is resolved when a Third
World cardinal nominated by the Pope just before his death appears at the
conclave and instantly convinces its members with his authentic approach
which focuses on global solidarity. The problem is that he is biologically an
intersex person assigned male at birth who has a uterus and ovaries—Lawrence
decides to ignore this and proclaims him the new Pope . . .
   One should also note that the new Pope planned to submit himself to a
surgery that would remove his uterus and ovaries, but cancels his plan with the
argument that he wants to be the way God made him . . . In short, his argument
is basically a conservative one, he wants to be in his psychic identity what he is
biologically, exactly what is for the LGBT+ ideology the worst position: the gap
between biological sex and symbolic sexual identity is perceived as something
to be abolished. A truly subversive twist would be that the new Pope is
biologically fully a man but rejects to be a man in his psychic identity since he
experiences himself as trans.
   Furthermore, the final solution of Conclave is very ambiguous: the actual
problems that beset the Church are not really resolved but just magically
recede into the background with the arrival of the intersex cardinal who works
like a deus ex machina. In contrast to Conclave, the miniseries Disclaimer
(2024), yet another masterpiece from Alfonzo Quaron, concludes with an
outstanding case of such a Hegelian reconciliation although its narrative relies
on multiple superpositions without a clear final collapse—how can this be?
Here is a (simplified) resume of the narrative8:

   Catherine Ravenscroft, a famed documentary journalist, discovers she is a
   prominent character in a novel Perfect Stranger that appeared under a
   pseudonym and purports to reveal a secret she has tried to keep hidden. The
   novel paints Catherine as a terrible mother and wife whose self-absorbed
                               Acts of Reconciliation                         287


   affair with 19-year-old stranger Jonathan while on vacation in Italy led to
   his death and the near-death of her own 4-year-old son. This story, full of
   juicy sexual details, disturbs the life of Catherine and all the people around
   her, her husband Robert, her son Nicholas, and her coworkers. We gradually
   learn that the book published by Jonathan’s father Stephen was written by
   his wife Nancy, the deceased mother of Jonathan; it is a fictional account of
   how Nancy perceived her son’s final days.

In the finale, Catherine—when she finally speaks in her own voice, after being
silenced and vilified—opens up to Stephen in a harrowing monologue about
the horrific night before his son’s death where he brutally raped her for three-
plus hours. So the following day in Italy, when Jonathan seemingly became a
hero and ran out into the ocean to save a young Nicholas from drowning and
Jonathan ended up drowning in the rough seas instead, Catherine didn’t shout
out to help her rapist. She explains to Stephen (and to viewers) that his death
meant she never had to speak about that night, so she let fate take its course.
She’d never had to relive her trauma out loud, until now, when she is forced to
share because of Stephen’s relentless and misguided pursuit of vengeance.
   This brings us to the true meaning of the title: although Perfect Stranger
begins with an inverted disclaimer (“any resemblance with actual events and
persons is not accidental”), does the fact that the book is full of Nancy’s
fantasies not prove that the disclaimer is to be taken in its standard form (any
such resemblance really is contingent)? The scene of Catherine flirting with
and seducing Jonathan on the beach and later in her hotel room are staged in
a ridiculously exaggerated non-realist way—however, such staging is justified
in view of the fact that we are dealing with Nancy’s imagination.
   The true achievement of the series resides in the ambiguity of its ending
which elicits two (almost symmetrically opposed) readings. The predominant
one sees the ending as a moment of catharsis when all characters involved get
rid of their illusions and are forced to assume reality as it is—to quote Cuaron
himself: “Almost everyone has created a judgment of Catherine that is
completely different from the ending that we reveal. It was a way for audiences
to confront their own judgments.”9 To quote Hegel again, Evil is the gaze itself
which perceives Evil all around itself: the Evil is not in what Catherine did with
288                                Quantum History


Jonathan, the Evil is in the gaze of others who perceive her acts as evil. For this
first reading, the finale thus enacts the passage from projecting onto Catherine
our prejudices and desires to a sobering awakening which compels us to accept
what Catherine (and Jonathan and all of us) really are.
   This brutal catharsis is best exemplified in the fate of Graham: from being
the instigator of the campaign against Catherine and ruthlessly pursuing his
goal of revenge (killing Nicholas and Catherine), he ends up alone in the
garden of his house, consigning not only the remaining copies of Perfect
Stranger and intimate photos of Catherine but even all the personal remainders
of his deceased wife Nancy to the flames. He is absolutely alone, probably
considering suicide. In the last photo he throws into the fire, we see that the
five-year-old Nick observed Jonathan brutally raping his mother, a fact of
which Catherine herself was not aware (she thought Nick is safely asleep in his
bedroom and she complied with Jonathan’s orders just to keep Nick in his
blessed ignorance)—so Catherine and Nick have to achieve their own
awakening to the brutal reality.
   However, there is another reading which captures much more adequately
the final twist of the film: what if reconciliation doesn’t mean a new state of
peace but primarily the reconciliation with the very tensions, perversions and
inconsistencies that characterize social life and especially sexuality? This sense
of reconciliation is the Hegelian one: we fight a threat, an obstacle that prevents
us from achieving our goal, and reconciliation doesn’t mean our victory over
the obstacle, the integration of the obstacle into our order as its subordinate
moment, but rather the insight into how what we perceived as an obstacle is
our own condition of possibility—if this obstacle disappears, our own order
disintegrates. This certainly holds for Nazi anti-Semitism: the whole Nazi
identity is based on fighting the Jewish plot. With regard to Disclaimer, this
means that it is not enough to condemn the rapist and accept the truth
disclosed by a woman who finally dares to say it all. What if the dark fantasies
that we attribute to the enemy are part of our own identity, so that we have to
learn to live with them?
   It is thus all too simple to say that, at the end of the series when the evil spell
cast by the book Perfect Stranger is broken, all the main characters are
compelled to assume reality as it really was—the lesson of the end is much
                                Acts of Reconciliation                            289


more ambiguous. Already earlier in the series, when Graham is forced to admit
that Nancy’s book doesn’t fully fit facts, he justifies Nancy’s small lies as part of
her effort to “get rid of the ballast of truth”: through her redactions, the truth
(of Catherine’s evil) appears in its purity, as it is, delivered of the ballast of its
imperfect empirical reality. However, we should recall here the basic lesson of
Hegel: when a notion is actualized imperfectly, this imperfection of reality
with regard to its notion always indicates an imperfection of this notion itself.
Recall Hegel’s passage from state (the highest figure of objective spirit) to
religion as the form of absolute spirit: really-existing states never fully fit the
notion of a state—if we want to fully actualize the notion of state as a community
reconciled with itself, we get a state which is no longer a state but a religious
community. So if we want to represent the idea of Catherine’s evil in its pure
form, delivered of the ballast of empirical truth, we have to abandon this idea
itself (which is false) . . .
   The ending thus in no way implies that now, when the full truth is told, we
can get rid of illusions and fantasies. First, at the level of facts, the character of
Jonathan is morally ambiguous: yes, he brutally raped Catherine in Italy, but
the next morning on the beach he immediately reacts to her desperate calls
and swims into the deep sea to save Nicholas, paying the price for this heroic
act when he himself drowns. Traumatized by the brutal rape, Catherine sees
Jonathan drowning but doesn’t do anything. She is faithful to her husband in
reality but she fantasizes about flirting: while drinking wine in the bar before
the rape, Catherine doesn’t react to Jonathan’s flirting gestures, she tells herself:
“Maybe I’ll fantasize about this moment later.” And she left (forgets) the key in
the door of her room so that Jonathan can later enter her room . . .
   What this indicates is that the fantasized versions display their own libidinal
truth—or, as Lacan put it, truth has the structure of a fiction. This paradox
holds also (maybe even especially) for political life. There are conspiracy
theories, real and fictional, which are not true but nevertheless explain
everything—I have written elsewhere about Robert Harris’s The Ghost, for
example. In Lacanian terms, the clandestine meetings and secret schemes of
these conspiracy theories are not part of reality, but they are real—why?
Because they render visible the shared blindness of both sides. The title of
Aldous Huxley’s outstanding novel Eyeless in Gaza is taken from a phrase in
290                             Quantum History


John Milton’s Samson Agonistes: in the Old Testament, Samson was expected to
deliver Israel from the Philistine yoke, but he was captured by the Philistines,
his eyes were burned out and he was taken to Gaza, where he was forced to
work at grinding grain in a mill: “ask for this great deliverer now, and find him
/ Eyeless in Gaza at the Mill with slaves.” Who is today, in the war between
Israel and Hamas,“eyeless in Gaza,” Hamas or the Israeli racist fundamentalists?
In some sense both are blinded by their acts: Hamas expected to deliver
Palestinians from the Israeli yoke, but now it serves Israel to further enslave or
expel Palestinians; Israeli fundamentalists expected to create a safe Great Israel
from the river to the sea, but now they are reinforcing anti-Semitism all around
the world. And although the conflict is between Hamas and Israeli hardline
Zionists, we should abandon all illusions that there is a clear line to separate
“extremists” from the majority of the population: today the large majority of
Israeli Jews are opposed to the two-state solution.
   Back to Disclaimer again, one should also note that, while Catherine is
exculpated of her guilt at the end and recognized as a victim, the person who
comes closest to being guilty (apart from Jonathan) is again a woman, his
mother Nancy who wrote Perfect Stranger, the narrative which embellishes her
son’s past and fills in the gaps with her own fantasies. Emily (Graham’s wife),
not Graham, is the ultimate culprit for the narrative she constructs and which
seduces the men (Graham, Robert, Nicholas) into surrendering to it and
projecting into it their own fears and fantasies. Emily is pathologically attached
to her son: after learning of his death, she moves into his room and gradually
withdraws into madness. There is a strange repetition at work in the series:
Nancy’s pathological attachment to Jonathan after his death mirrors Catherine’s
self-declared full happiness on the day before the rape, alone with her son and
with no husband around (a clear hint at the cracks in their marriage). Does her
flirting not indicate a shadow in this happiness? And does she not reach this
happiness of being alone with her son again at the very end of the series?
Although her final happiness is a bitter reunion of two ruined persons, there is
nonetheless a clear Christian dimension in it: “For where two or three gather
in my name, there I am with them.”(Matthew 18:20) Christ is neither the
subject nor the object of love, he is love itself: “Whoever does not love does not
know God, because God is love.”(John 4:8) Christian reunion is, at its most
                                 Acts of Reconciliation                        291


basic, not a happy reunion which makes the couple obliterate their despair:
what is shared in the reunion is the despair itself.
   Am I just projecting this ambiguity into the series? No, since what points in
this direction are already the formal features of the series: the story is revealed
in a non-linear fashion with scenes alternating between a holiday in Italy
(young Catherine’s encounter with Jonathan and his subsequent death by
drowning) and back home in London twenty years later (the truth emerges,
the consequences). The series also uses the technique of the unreliable narrator
in that the events in Italy are told twice: first from Nancy’s speculative point of
view and later from Catherine’s first person experience. Both these features
evoke the notion of quantum superpositions: reality itself, not just our (mis)
perception of it, maintains itself only when it is superposed by imagined
alternatives.
   These imagined alternatives are not simply evil, there is also an unexpected
utopian dimension in them. At the end, Catherine is not ready to pardon
Robert, and her rejection is fully justified: what she cannot forgive him is that
he felt relief when he learned she was brutally raped by Jonathan in the Italian
hotel—so it is much easier for him to accept that she was repeatedly brutally
raped than to accept that she enjoyed a passionate night of sex . . . We should
go all the way in drawing the consequences of this profound insight: the
passionate night of sex is not just Nancy’s dirty imagination, it could have
happened and it would be beautiful if it were to happen. It is a key part of
reconciliation to accept this.
   There is, however, yet another mode of reconciliation, a much more
traumatic one, that we get in Mark Romanek’s outstanding Never Let Me Go
(2010, screenplay by John Garland based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro).
Never Let Me Go struck me as arguably the most depressing film I’ve ever seen.
I suspect this is because today, with all the crises that more and more affect our
daily lives, from global warming to wars and the threat of digital control, we
find ourselves in a position very similar to that of the heroes of Romanek’s
film. Its heroes are not AI creatures but humans who find themselves in a
similar position of exclusion from “normal” human society.
   Never Let Me Go mixes in an extraordinarily efficient way a science-fiction
premise with intimate psychological drama and love story. A medical
292                               Quantum History


breakthrough in late 1950s has extended the human lifespan beyond 100 years,
but to achieve this, the state grew clones who are destined to donate their
organs to prolong the lives of mortally ill people. However, in order for this
activity to become acceptable, a profound change had to occur in public
morals, radically redefining what counts as socially acceptable—driven by the
promise of survival, people accepted this since clones were artificially produced
outside the network of kinship relations and were thus perceived as beings
who didn’t count as fully human.
                                         *
The story begins in 1978 and follows three children, the young Kathy H, along
with her friends Tommy D and Ruth C, who live at Hailsham, a traditional
boarding school. The teachers, called guardians, encourage students to be
health-conscious and create artwork, and they have little contact with the
world beyond the school’s fences. Miss Lucy, a perceptive new guardian, tells
her class that they are all clones who exist to be organ donors and are destined
to die, or complete, early in their adulthoods after a couple of donations
(maximum four); she is quickly fired by the headmistress. As time passes,
Kathy grows attracted to Tommy, but Ruth wins him for herself despite having
engaged in teasing him. This love triangle is resolved years later when a broken
Ruth reveals she only seduced Tommy because she was afraid to be alone; she
is consumed with guilt and wishes to help Tommy and Kathy seek a deferral
(there is a rumour circulating among the clones that if a couple proves they are
really in love, their donations will be postponed). She leaves them with the
address of Madame, whom she believes has the power to help them, and soon
dies on the operating table during her second donation. Tommy and Kathy,
now his “carer” (the one who stands by a clone during donations in order to
make his/her life easier), finally enter a relationship, but after they discover that
deferrals are a myth, Tommy explodes with grief and anger as he used to as a
child. (One should shamelessly admit that the same scream appears at the end
of a popular spy bestseller, The Day Of the Locust by Terry Hayes: “Tod is
screaming mindlessly in imitation of the siren of the police car that has come
to his rescue. This scream represents a hysterical release of the frustration and
horror which he has never quite been able to put into words.”10) Tommy dies
during his fourth donation, leaving Kathy alone, and after a decade of caring,
                               Acts of Reconciliation                          293


we see her contemplating the ruins of her childhood. Finally getting ready to
begin her own donations, she questions in voice-over how different—or not so
different—her life has been from normal people’s.11
   The book’s (and the film’s) big enigma remains unanswered: why the main
characters never try to escape their fate of an early death (although they could
easily attempt to disappear into society)? The story is pervaded by radical
ambiguity with regard to this point: do the givers accept their fate because they
are not fully human or do they accept it because they are in some basic sense
more human than the rest of us, ordinary humans? Numerous comments offer
a whole series of divergent answers. First, there is the obvious scientific one:
the givers are “genetically engineered clones. Their genes were designed to
eliminate the fright-flight response.” Then, there is external control: Hailsham
is surrounded by an electrified fence, all givers wear bracelets which register
their movements so that they can be located at any point, etc. Finally, there is
the givers’ psychic stance: they have no outside perspective, they are unable to
develop any kind of dream of a better outside into which to escape, plus they
possess no legal documents to identify them in the external world . . .
   However, when they reach the age to become donors, they are moved from
Hailsham to Cottages, isolated countryside buildings where they see and
interact with “‘real’ humans living their lives, growing old, having relationships,
feeling and crying and laughing the same way they do. Even with the
brainwashing as kids, how could they not question their rights and purpose as
adults? This is how the human brain works when processing experiences, it
elaborates, creates questions and motivates changes, why don’t they? Why is it
that every single “real” human among them has zero ethical dilemmas and
doesn’t rebel against the state of things, though they clearly see that those
“givers” are fully humans?” They even escape to a nearby small town, visit an
ordinary pub, etc.—so why do not some of them at least kill themselves?
   The weirdness of this feature becomes obvious if we compare Never Let Me
Go with Island (Michael Bay, 2005)—a comparison solicited by Ishiguro
himself who pointed out that he wanted to do the opposite of an individual
finding him/herself in a similar situation of total control and then rebelling
against it. Island is about Lincoln Six Echo (played by Ewan McGregor), who
struggles to fit into the highly structured world in which he lives, isolated in a
294                             Quantum History


compound on an island, and a series of strange events that unfold make him
question how truthful that world is. After he learns the compound inhabitants
are clones used for organ harvesting as well as surrogates for wealthy people in
the outside world, he attempts to escape with Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet
Johansson) and expose the illegal cloning movement . . . What we get here is a
standard Hollywood-Leftist story of a heroic individual rebelling against the
oppressing regime; he triumphs and ends up at a lone island of his own with his
beloved. Nothing like this happens in Never Let Me Go where the lives of the
three donors are meaningless—but they are meaningless precisely because the
meaning of their life (in the ordinary sense of its function) is fixed in advance—
they know why they are here, to serve as donors . . . Boris Groys wrote:

   Every generation enters history during its desiring, active phase—and then
   leaves it without offering anything that the next generation could embrace.
   On the contrary, in its second phase—after a life full of disillusionment and
   frustration—every generation presents itself to the next generation as
   historical garbage that has to be removed to make way for a new desire.
   It is obvious that this “tact of natality” excludes the possibility of any
   transgenerational project, beyond the eternal return of the desire for such a
   project. Thus, the return of communism is as improbable as the return of
   any other transgenerational project. At the same time a return of the desire
   for communism is not only possible but almost unavoidable.12

But are today, amidst the ecological crisis, transgenerational projects really
impossible? And, to risk even a step further, did not some active Communist
revolutionaries perceive even themselves as the last garbage to be removed (or,
to use a well-known paradox, as the last cannibals to be eaten)? Or, as Brecht
put it apropos of revolutionary violence in his The Measure Taken, one should
strive to become the last piece of dirt with whose removal the room will be
clean—this is Brecht’s version of the justification of Stalinist purges, and the
stance described by Brecht strangely echoes the stance of the donors in Never
Let Me Go.
   In a further paradoxical twist, this fixed meaning confers on their lives a
depressive beauty and sustains their longing for love and vocation (painting in
the movie) as a way to transcend their narrow predicament. Maybe, precisely
                                Acts of Reconciliation                            295


because the fate of their lives is fixed and prevents them from dedicating
themselves to love or vocation, they experience the need for love and vocation
in an all the more urgent and profound way—you fully experience what really
matters in your life only when you miss it. So the donors in the film are not
lacking perspective on the outside reality—on the contrary, they attain a
perspective which we, “normal” people fully immersed into social reality,
automatically deny. It is our “normal” everyday existence which is a lie. The
pessimistic conclusion to be drawn from all this is that if we fail to assume our
mortality, this does not make us ethically better persons: only against the
depressive background of an impenetrable deadly threat can we occasionally
act in a kind and compassionate way. And is this also not the lesson for us
today? Not a cheap humanist optimism but the full acceptance that we are
doomed as the only ray of hope. If, maybe, an AI machine will effectively begin
to think and acquire a kind of self-awareness, will its self-experience not be
akin to the self-experience of the donors in Never Let Me Go?
   What makes Never Let Me Go such a truly depressing masterpiece is that it
provides no easy way out; part of its traumatic impact is precisely the fact that
the reason why givers do not rebel (or try to escape at least) is not specified—
again, in contrast to usual catastrophe movies in which the external threat (evil
conspiracy, virus, aliens . . .) is sooner or later identified. We find ourselves in a
situation of unspecified mortal dread which deprives individuals of their basic
tendency to survive, hope, and fight, and what makes this dread all the more
oppressive is its “abstract” nature, registered only as an oppressive atmosphere.
Even when they still desire things (as in the love triangle of Tommy, Kathy, and
Ruth where sexual passion, jealousy, and envy intermingle), the joy of love is
tainted by the all-pervasive depressive background.
   It is too much to say that there is a contrast between the depressive
atmosphere and the intricacies of the love triangle: their love is an organic part
of the atmosphere, and one should not restrain from the staggering conclusion
that this depressive atmosphere make the three donors ethically much better
people. The reason Ruth (superbly played by Keira Knightley) breaks down
and confesses her manipulations to Tommy and Kathy is that she is well aware
how close to her “completion” she is already after her first donation—one can
safely presume that, without the traumatic background of being a clone raised
296                              Quantum History


for donations, she would remain what she was, a rather insolent seductress
playing with other people’s emotions and even joyfully bringing them pain. I
find the crux of the film in depicting how the depressive atmosphere of
knowing one’s fate affects all the spheres of subjects’ lives.
   So let’s go to the end in these risky speculations: what one should reject is
the fake “wise” concluding meditation of Kathy where she arrives at the result
that, in some sense, all “normal” humans resemble clones: we are all caught in
destiny imposed by an anonymous other and awaiting a certain death . . . Or, to
put it in a different way: Never Let Me Go struggles with the big enigma of our
time: why do people not rebel—even when they clearly know their way of life
leads to a global catastrophe? Why is indifference emerging more and more as
the predominant stance of our life which is only occasionally interrupted by
wild rebellions that really change nothing?
   The answer suggested by the film is much more subtle than a simple critique
of conformism since it introduces a key difference: we “normal” humans do
not know when and how, exactly, we will die, and this uncertainly sustains our
secret disavowed hope that—maybe, just maybe—we will not die. In other
words, our “normal” everyday existence is based on a disavowal of what we all
know well, but at an abstract impersonal (not-subjectivized) way. To paraphrase
the well-known syllogism, all people are mortal, but maybe I am not . . . In
Never Let Me Go, we are compelled to fully assume our mortality—the ultimate
act of reconciliation.

In a recent paper,1 Michael Millerman argues that far-right Russian philosopher
Aleksandr Dugin is a legitimate heir to Heidegger. For Millerman, Heidegger
is not just one of the sources or inspirations of Dugin’s philosophy. A proper
understanding of his thought plays a key role in determining Russia’s future: to
master Heidegger’s thought is “the main strategic task of the Russian people
and Russian society,” and “the key to the Russian tomorrow.”2 This is why the
question of Dugin’s Heideggerianism is crucial for our understanding of what
goes on now in Russia at a spiritual level. How, then, does Heidegger become
“Khaydegger” (his name written in Russian)? To what subtle changes does
Dugin submit Heidegger’s edifice?
   For Dugin, the transcendental-ontological analysis of Dasein that Heidegger
deploys in his Being and Time is not universal: every civilization gives birth to its
specific form rooted in a collective spirituality. The Russian Dasein is thus
different from the German one; it focuses on “narod,” the people in the sense of
German Volk, not the state, not the nation (nationalism), not race (Fascism), not
class (Marxism), and especially not liberal individualism. “Narod” is thus an
ontological category, it designates a historically-specific form of the disclosure of
Being, of how its members perceive what matters in their lives, what gives their
lives meaning, what freedom and dignity mean in their spiritual universe. For an
authentic Russian, “freedom” is something different from the liberal notion of
human rights and freedoms, it is a mode of free immersion into the spiritual
substance of one’s people; only this can provide dignity and meaning to life .

                                                                                 297
298                              Quantum History


   For Dugin, philosophy is thus immanently political, inclusive of advocating
war: war in Ukraine is a war between Western global modernism and the
Eurasian spirituality. There is war because (as Heidegger saw) the West reached
its deepest decline in global liberal hegemony, Western modernity is Evil
embodied, while Russia did not yet fully articulate its Eurasian spiritual
identity—this task still lies ahead, and only Russian philosophy grounded in
Heidegger can do it. Here Dugin replaces Germany (for Heidegger, the unique
spiritual nation) with Russia: a “new beginning”—the awakening expected by
Heidegger, a new Ereignis—will take place in Russia, not in Germany, not even
in the West. Dugin substantiates this with reference to the Russian language
itself: he notes how terms that sound artificial in Heidegger’s German (like
“in-der-Welt-sein,” being-in-the-world) have much more natural everyday
equivalents in Russian.
   Dugin is not simply a Rightist against the Left, he notices how at a certain
point Bolshevism itself took a Eurasian turn.3 One should mention here
Aleksandr Blok, the great Russian poet who wrote The Twelve, the great ode to
the October Revolution: he was quickly disappointed by the Bolshevik Revolution
and his last work before his early death in 1921 was a patriotic poem “Scythians”
which advocates a kind of “pan-Mongolism,” a clear precursor to today’s
Eurasianism—Russia should mediate not only between the East and the West
but also politically between the Reds and the Whites to end the self-destructive
civil war. This is also why Dugin prefers Stalin to Lenin: in 1921 Lenin conceived
the task of Bolshevism as bringing Russia as fast as possible to Western modernity,
while this reference to the West disappears with Stalin.
   Dugin is also not simply opposed to the West: his target is modernity which
culminates in liberal individualism. One should note here that a similar
reading of Heidegger as a tool to fend off global Western modernization is
practiced not only in Russia or some other Slavic countries but also in
non-Slavic countries from Romania to Iran. (In my own country, Slovenia,
some Heideggerians were interpreting Dostoyevsky—whom Dugin otherwise
rejects—as a case of overcoming Western nihilism.) Dugin solicits every
country, every people, to get rid of the liberal-individualist yoke of global
modernity and discover its own specific spirituality. The role of Russia is to
defeat the global West and thus to give each country, the Western ones
                        Moderately Conservative Communism                        299


included, the freedom to discover its own spirituality—one may say that Dugin
provides a philosophical version of the idea of a multipolar world embodied in
the political notion of BRICS.
  Dugin’s influence should nonetheless not be overrated: he stands for an
extreme tendency of creating through military victory a new Eurasian empire
dominated by Russian Orthodoxy, and his partisans consider Putin way too soft.
However, what Dugin writes should be taken seriously as an indicator of the
dangers posed by neo-Fascism. In a short text from September 2024, Aleksandr
Dugin did something that shocked even me, used to all kinds of bad surprises in
theory and politics: he applied Lacan’s Real/Symbolic/Imaginary triad to analyze
the role of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the forthcoming US presidential
elections. Here is how Dugin presents the triad RSI:

  The Real is the domain where every object is strictly identical to itself. This
  absolute identity (A=A) excludes the very possibility of becoming, i.e., of
  being in a state of transformation. Thus, the Real is the zone of pure death
  and nothingness. There are no changes, movements, or relations. The Real is
  true, like the truth of nothingness that has no alternatives.
     The Symbolic is the domain where nothing equals itself, where one thing
  always refers to another. It is an escape from the Real, motivated by the
  desire to avoid death and falling into nothingness. It is here that content,
  relationships, movements, and transformations are born, but always in a
  dreamlike state. The Symbolic is the unconscious. The essence of a symbol
  is that it points to something other than itself (it does not matter what
  specifically, as long as it is not itself).
     The Imaginary is the domain where the dynamic of the Symbolic stops,
  but without the object dying and collapsing into the Real. The Imaginary is
  what we mistakenly take for Being, the world, ourselves—nature, society,
  culture, and politics. It is everything, yet it is also a lie. Every element of the
  Imaginary is actually a frozen moment of the Symbolic. Wakefulness is a
  form of sleep that does not realize itself. Everything in the Imaginary refers
  to the Symbolic but presents itself as supposedly “Real.”
     In the Real, A=A is true. In the Symbolic, A=A is false. In the Imaginary,
  no object is identical to itself, but unlike in the Symbolic, it doesn’t want to
300                              Quantum History


   admit this—neither to itself nor to others. The Real is nothing. The Symbolic
   is ever-changing becoming. The Imaginary consists of false nodes of the
   frozen Symbolic.4

   Everything is wrong in this description: what Dugin misses is precisely the
interconnection of the three dimensions illustrated by the figure of the
Borromean knot. The Real is not a self-identity (A=A is strictly the formula of
symbolic identity) but an obstacle immanent to the Symbolic, the impossibility
of A=A, of any symbolic identity to fully actualize itself. (A classic example: the
Real of sexual difference means that, in a patriarchal society, a woman cannot
achieve the full actualization of her potentials. Or: the Real of class antagonism
means that a society is never an organic Whole.) The Symbolic itself is a system
of differential identities: the identity of each element resides in its differences
from other elements. In this sense, the Symbolic cannot be simply identified
with the unconscious: it is primarily what Lacan calls the big Other, the socio-
symbolic order which provides the basic coordinates of a society. ( Along these
lines, the Name-of-the-Father is a figure of the symbolic Law.) The aim of the
analytic process is to bring a subject to the point at which s/he accepts that
there is no big Other, that every figure of the big Other is traversed by the Real
of an antagonism. The Imaginary also cannot be reduced to a frozen Symbolic:
imaginary is also, at its most basic, what Lacan called the experience of a
dismembered body (le corps morcele), the chaotic flow of bodily parts not yet
united in a body . . . However, what we should focus on is how this applies to
the forthcoming US elections. In Dugin’s view, Kamala Harris represents the
Symbolic, she

   embodies an invitation to transgression, the legalization of perversions, and
   liberation from all prohibitions and norms, i.e., the expansion of the
   Symbolic realm. The Democrats’ platform is a structure of well-tempered
   delirium: more LGBT, more cancel culture, more illegal immigrants, more
   drugs and gender reassignment surgeries, more deconstruction of old
   orders, more BLM and critical race theory.

The Democrats’ platform is thus in some sense psychoanalytic: since the
Symbolic is unconscious, it repeats the old Leftist-Freudian gesture of liberating
                       Moderately Conservative Communism                       301


the unconscious from the constraints of oppressive order. But what Lacan
knew and the Leftist Freudians ignored is the basic lesson of all revolutions:
when the repressed symbolic unconscious destroys the imaginary order and is
set free, such a direct assertion of the unconscious immediately gives birth to
a new fixed imaginary order which is much more oppressive and totalitarian
than the previous order . . . It may appear that Dugin hit the right button
against Lacano-Marxists—when asked “What were the political consequences
of Jacques Lacan’s teaching?”, Jacques-Alain Miller (who really knows Lacan)
replied:

   Lacan said that he was not progressive, that he did not believe in progress.
   For him, history was rather circular, in a way. . . . He was not progressive, he
   was not conservative and, at the same time, he did not believe in total change
   because he thought that if you leave a master, or destroy a master, then you
   will find another master. We have seen that very clearly with Soviet
   communism, for example. Stalin was a much fiercer master than the Tsar.5

But Miller is here not very original: such a warning against radical change is an
old conservative-liberal commonplace first formulated by Edmund Burke in
his critique of the French Revolution. (The case of Hegel is more subtle: in his
Phenomenology of Spirit he has shown how absolute freedom necessarily turns
into terror, but this passage was for him a necessary step towards the
establishment of civil peace.) The gap that separates Miller and Dugin appears
when we pass to the next question: how are we to counteract this radical
tendency frozen in new totalitarian Imaginary? Dugin claims that the only
way to really undermine Democratic delirium is to rely on right-wing symbolic
delirium represented by groups like Proud Boys and pro-Trump commentators:

   Where can we find a counterattack on the frozen liberal Imaginary, which
   has turned into overt totalitarianism? The answer is obvious: in the opposite
   pole, which we can call “Trumpist Symbolic.” We saw the signs of this
   strategy during Trump’s first presidential campaign in the Alt-Right, on
   4chan, in the figure of the meme Pepe the Frog, in reptilian conspiracy
   theories, chaos magic, and the delirious theories of QAnon. We might call
   this “esoteric Trumpism” or, more precisely, “psychedelic Trumpism.” If the
302                             Quantum History


  Democrats and their transgressive practices have become the Imaginary—
  frozen in totalitarian prescriptive power structures—then critique from the
  Symbolic has naturally focused on the Republicans. Of course, not all
  Republicans, but the most liberated, “unhinged,” and delirious factions.

And the key figure for Dugin is J.D. Vance—he even speculates Vance may be
familiar with Lacan:

  In Vance, the Democrats’ psychoanalytic strategy fails, as Vance himself
  embodies the atypical right-wing Symbolic pole. It is even possible that he
  understands this and is familiar with Lacan.

So here is where we finish: Vance as a Lacanian . . . The underlying political
vision of Dugin which sustains such madness is not just a project of European
nationalists and traditional Muslims working together against global liberalism
but also a project of Left and Right working together against the liberal centre:

  In the West, there are both excellent right-wing and very respectable left-
  wing figures. For instance, the AfD (Alternative for Germany) is a remarkable
  right-wing movement, and Sahra Wagenknecht is an outstanding leftist.

But the split is not only between the honest true anti-globalist Left and the
globalist Left; there is a homologous split on the Right, between true anti-
globalist Right and the Right which willingly participates in the globalist
liberal game:

  there are European far-right individuals who join forces with Nazis from
  the Azov battalion to fight against us [Russia]. These far-right individuals
  conveniently ignore the fact that Zelensky is a Jewish liberal clown, a drug
  addict, and a pervert. How can these people be considered right-wing? They
  are merely service dogs on the liberal NATO leash.

We learn a lot from this passage with a clear anti-Semitic sting: NATO is not a
right-wing organization but a liberal military union opposed by all true Right-
wingers (I am tempted to agree with this claim—with some reservations). The
basic implication of these lines is clear: the utter demonization of European
liberalism:
                       Moderately Conservative Communism                     303


   There are no good liberals. All liberals are aligned with the world government
   and Western hegemony. Anyone on their side is an absolute enemy of both
   true right-wing and true left-wing people. This is because capitalism is pure
   evil and must be destroyed from both the right and the left, simultaneously.6

These lines are not a crazy dream—in some sense they are true: the ongoing
war between Russia and Ukraine is ultimately not a war for territory or
economic and political influence, it is a properly metaphysical war. So what
will happen when/if the joined Right and Left annihilate liberalism? Will it not
be an even more brutal pure conflict? Plus how can the idea that “capitalism is
pure evil and must be destroyed from both the right and the left, simultaneously”
be united with Dugin’s advocacy of Russia, China, etc., which are not anti-
capitalist but simply authoritarian-capitalist? Dugin is anti-capitalist only
insofar as capitalism is liberal, he accepts capitalism controlled and regulated
by a strong nation-state grounded in national tradition—a dream of all fascists.
As Lacan and Miller have been repeating for more than half a century,
capitalism is global, which means that the opposition between its liberal
version and its authoritarian version is immanent to it.
   During the last decade of his work, Lacan was obsessed with Marx’s critique
of political economy. The central category of his work in this period, his notion
of surplus-enjoyment (plus-de-jouir), is elaborated through a constant
reference to Marx’s notion of surplus-value. This reliance on Marx indicates
that Lacan was desperately searching for a way out of capitalism, and that he

   envisioned psychoanalysis as the way out of capitalism, which in some
   sense, was already underway in the years after 1968. But he asks more, that
   psychoanalysis be the way out of capitalism for more than just some.7

Lacan’s quest for the way out of capitalism leads him in the direction of
sainthood, but he defines sainthood in a very specific way: a saint is the one
who wholly adopts excremental identity, who is reduced to a piece of shit—it
is not that we should all become saints in the usual sense of the term. What we
should learn is to step outside the capitalist superego pressure to acquire and
to be “more and more,” to incessant progress, outside its economy of expanded
self-reproduction which also survived in classical Marxism and really-existing
304                              Quantum History


Socialism. One could speculate that what Lacan aims at with sainthood is close
to Gelassenheit, a term used by Angelus Silesius which is generally translated as
“releasement.” Gelassenheit, a key word of Heidegger’s later thought, names the
fundamental attunement (Grundstimmung) with which human beings are to
authentically relate to other beings and to being itself. It contrasts with the
fundamental attunement—or rather dis-attunement—of the will.8 Here is the
key proposition from Lacan’s Television:

   A saint’s business, to put it clearly, is not caritas. Rather, he acts as trash
   (déchet); his business being trashitas (il décharite).9

And here is Francois Regnault’s commentary on this proposition:

   Here begins the paradox, for in common image a saint does indeed charity.
   Lacan suggests that it is precisely this charity that the saint gets rid of, the
   saint discharges himself of the burden of charity. And in this way, “trachity”
   (déchariter) is a condensation of trash and charity and, I add, begins like
   décharge, the loaded term that it is.10

Lacan’s stance against charity gains new force today when charitable activities
have become a key component of big corporations (just recall the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation with tens of billions of dollars’ worth of donations).
For Lacan, charity remains firmly within the traditional logic of the Supreme
Good: it allows corporations to re-inscribe their superego incessant striving
for surplus-profit into the contribution to the welfare of all. But can we
effectively suspend the capitalist superego through sainthood which is
ultimately an inner subjective stance?
   Lacan’s overall view is a pessimistic one: our future will in all probability be
a new form of global capitalism supplemented by new religious nationalisms
(which is effectively happening now), and psychoanalysis itself as a specific
practice (in which the analyst functions as an excremental saint) will also
probably disappear. Psychoanalysis is not eternal, it is possible only within
specific social conditions. I remain here a Marxist: the capitalist superego is
also not just an inner subjective stance, it is embedded in a complex network
of social and ideological relations and in practices which materialize these
relations, and the anti-capitalist struggle should go on at this level.
                       Moderately Conservative Communism                       305


   Miller drew the opposite conclusion about the social implications of Lacan’s
theory: Lacan’s critique of the 1968 student protests was basically a defense of
moderate and modest liberalism which compels us to avoid extremes and to
maintain a fragile balance of the components of the social Borromean knot.
We definitely get in Lacan a conservative aspect, a liberal aspect and a Leftist
anti-capitalist aspect, but Dugin all too quickly identifies traditional liberalism
and the Cancel Culture which, although it radicalizes certain liberal tendencies,
is opposed by many liberals. Plus it is Dugin himself who, in his eschatological
vision of the struggle to death between global liberalism and the combined
“good” Left and Right, advocates a radical violent change which cannot but end
in new terror.11
   So where do I stand here? I define myself as a moderately conservative
Communist. A Communist because it seems obvious to me that only a radical
social change will enable us to cope with the mortal threats to our survival (the
environmental changes, AI controlling our lives, new social disturbances).
Conservative because, if one follows Walter Benjamin, insofar as revolutions in
the linear-evolutionary sense mean big victories which leave devastation in
their wake (British colonization of India pushed India towards modernity but
left behind millions of dead, etc.), we should not be afraid to say that the
Benjaminian revolution would be the ultimate counter-revolution: the return
and revenge of all the discarded and disposable against the terrible price of
progress. Moderate because we should always consider the unintended
catastrophic consequences of what we are doing and learn to combine radical
measures with steps back. When, in 1922, after winning the Civil War against
all odds, the Bolsheviks had to retreat into NEP (the “New Economic Policy” of
allowing a much wider scope of market economy and private property), Lenin
wrote a wonderful short text “On Ascending a High Mountain.”12 He uses the
simile of a climber who has to retreat back to the valley from his first attempt
to reach a new mountain peak in order to describe what a retreat means in a
revolutionary process, i.e., how does one retreat without opportunistically
betraying one’s fidelity to the Cause.
   This triad of moderate conservative Communism, my own socio-political
Borromean knot, perfectly fits what Lacan aims at with his recourse to this figure.
Although it offers a version of politics different from Lacan’s anti-progressive
306                                Quantum History


pessimism, it remains anti-progressive pessimist Communism. And it rejoins
Lacan at his crucial critical insight about the May 1968 protests. Psychoanalysis
is as a rule misunderstood either in a pseudo-Leftist way (we should strive for
abolishing all forms of repression, for fully liberating sexuality) or in a conservative
way (a level of repression is necessary to prevent social disintegration and
public morality). Jacques Lacan offers here a surprise: he defines the goal of
psychoanalytic treatment in our era of permissiveness as the restoration of a
minimum of shame.13 The true opposition is not the one between free sexuality
and repression but the one between shamelessness and dignity. It is difficult to
overestimate the political relevance of Lacan’s stance: protesters attack the
shamelessness of their opponents and demand to be treated with dignity.
   Why shame? In his seminar “The Reverse of Psychoanalysis”(1969–1970),
Lacan’s reaction to the May 1968 events, he makes a much more important
point than the decried provocative statement: “What you aspire to as
revolutionaries is a master. You will get one.”—in his critique of protesting
students, he surprisingly says: “all you are lacking precisely is a bit of shame.”
Lacan repeatedly varies this motif, like saying that students “fear they might be
carried away by buffoonery. Let us start rather from the fact that buffoonery is
already there. Perhaps by mixing in a little shame, who knows, we may be able
to hold it back.” And he even concludes the Seminar with: “what I put forward,
for the majority of you, it is just that: I manage to make you ashamed, not too
much but precisely enough.”14
   Jacques-Alain Miller15 provides the background of this statement by way of
pointing out that we have to read contemporary shamelessness from the
perspective of a certain mutation in capitalism, no longer a capitalism that
relies on “repression of enjoyment,” as in Max Weber’s famous analysis of
permissiveness: “the new mode—if it bears the mark of a style at all—is rather
that of permissiveness, where what can sometimes be the cause of difficulty is
the prohibition on prohibiting.”16
                                           *
Lacan doesn’t advocate here a minimum of morality and/or repression that
should be maintained to prevent social disintegration—on the contrary, he
draws attention to what, already back in the 1940, the Frankfurt School
members referred to as “repressive desublimation”: what we are getting today
                        Moderately Conservative Communism                         307


is a kind of generalized perversion (openly doing what hysterics only dream
about), and as already Freud knew, nowhere is the Unconscious more
inaccessible, more repressed, than in perversion. The catch is that desire is in
itself, immanently, inconsistent, self-contradictory, traversed by what Freud
called “primordial repression,” which is why the permissiveness of perversion
ends up in a self-destructive deadlock which gives birth to the call for a new
Master. And, as the ongoing wave of new populism aptly demonstrated, this
new Master’s shamelessness by far exceeds the shamelessness of the old Leftist
protesters.
   One has to be very precise here: shame is not a defense against too much of
desire, it is a defense of desire, of the lack that constitutes it, against the excess
of its over-saturation which obliterates it. At this level, desire and need can also
be correlated as excess and lack: the capitalist excess of uselessness products
necessarily leads to a lack of things one actually needs for survival, and this
imbalance is structural: one cannot simply resolve it by way of producing
things people really need.17 And, at yet another level, is Israel now not caught
in a similar paradox with regard to its territorial expansion? Israel tries to
achieve security by way of occupying neighbouring territory from where an
enemy may attack it, as is now the case with southern Syria—“in Netanyahu’s
new Middle East, Syria could become Israel’s biggest strategic gain.”18 However,
the more neighbouring territory it occupies (with a view to annex it or at least
occupy it indefinitely), the more animosity this occupation triggers, so that
Israel will then be forced to occupy even more territory—and such a situation
makes one suspicious that the expansion itself is the true goal. So, again, the
more Israel does to secure its safety, the more it proclaims that its very survival
is in danger.

               The painted void


                      The Void: Wyeth, David

Andrew Wyeth’s masterpiece Christina’s World (1948) depicting a woman (Anna
Christina Olson) dragging herself through a tawny field towards a distant
homestead gave birth to a whole series of more optimistic imitations, homages
and versions—which could be seen as many attempts to cancel its traumatic
impact.1 The two exemplary new versions are photographer Alex Thompson’s
tribute to Andrew Wyeth’s Christina’s World taken in 2005 at the site of the Olsons’
house in South Cushing, Maine, and the Joshua Blankinship Modern Recreation
of Christina’s World by Wyeth.2 The main feature of these new versions are much
more lively colours which obfuscate the monotone grey-brown tone of the
original. One should also mention another key fact: the two buildings we see in
the background are moved much closer, with almost no space between them.
   Why is this last feature so important? Read properly, it belies the predominant
interpretation of the painting according to which “Wyeth portrays the
countryside as an escape, an arcadia. Christina leans towards her farmhouse.
She longs to be home again; she wants us to come with her.”3 Really? The gap
between the two buildings forms the lower part of a screen onto which we
expect the crawling woman to project her fantasies—it is this frame, not the
two buildings of her home, that attracts Christina, and the frame remains
empty. Wyeth-the-realist working in the age of Rothko and Pollock was right
to claim that he is also an abstractionist: its colours and formal dispositions are
more important than the painted content.



                                                                                309
310                              Quantum History


   Let us draw another analogy here—consider the uniqueness of Jean-Louis
David’s “The Death of Marat” (1793), which depicts the revolutionary journalist
slumped dead in his bath, his torso twisting to face the viewer.4 It is “the first
modernist painting,” according to T. J. Clark, however the oddity of the
painting’s overall structure is seldom noted: its upper half is almost totally
black. (This is not a realistic detail: the room in which Marat actually died had
lively wallpaper.) What does this black void stand for? The opaque body of the
People, the impossibility of representing the People—it is as if the impenetrable
dark background of the painting (the People) invades it, occupying its entire
upper half.
   What happens here is structurally homologous to a formal procedure often
found in film noir and Orson Welles movies, when the discord between figure
and background is mobilized: when a figure moves in a room, the effect is that
the two are somehow ontologically separated, as in a clumsy rear-projection
shot in which one can clearly see that the actor is not really in a room, but just
moving in front of a screen onto which the image of a room is projected. In “The
Death of Marat,” it appears as if we see Marat in his bathtub in front of a dark
screen onto which the fake background has not yet been projected—this is why
the effect can also be described as one of anamorphosis: we see the figure, while
the background remains an opaque stain; in order to see the background, we
would have to blur the figure. But what is impossible is to get the figure and the
background in the same focus. Is this not also the logic of the Jacobin Terror?
Individuals must be annihilated in order to make the People visible; the People’s
Will can be made visible only through the terrorist destruction of the individual’s
body? Therein resides the uniqueness of The Death of Marat: it concedes that
one cannot blur the individual in order to represent the People directly—all one
can do to come as close as possible to an image of the People is to show the
individual at the point of his disappearance—his tortured, mutilated dead body
against the background of the blur that “is” the People.5
   The woman in Wyeth’s painting is Christina Olson, his friend, who was a
disabled woman. We see her in front of her home in Maine close to the ocean,
and the reason she is on the ground, almost crawling across the field towards
her house, is that she was the victim of a degenerative muscular disorder.
                                The Painted Void                             311


Christina refused to use any mobility aids, so what we’re seeing in the painting
is her literally pulling herself across the field—back to her house—using just
her arms.6 Therein resides the link with Never Let Me Go: Wyeth stated that he
wanted

   to do justice to her extraordinary conquest of a life which most people
   would consider hopeless. If in some small way I have been able in paint to
   make the viewer sense that her world may be limited physically but by no
   means spiritually, then I have achieved what I set out do.7

Is this not exactly homologous with the situation of the heroes of Never Let Me
Go? Are they also not spiritually awakened through their very physical
limitation, much worse than that of Catherine’s? And what all of them—the
heroes of Never Let Me Go, David’s Marat, Wyeth’s Christina—share is that
they don’t fill in the empty frame with some ideological fantasy content (as we
usual mortals do).



         Courbet: The Deadlock of Male Desire

So let’s risk one step more: what David was for the French Revolution, Gustave
Courbet was for the Paris Commune. There is a well-known recent scandal
that concerns Courbet: in Metz, an incident occurred at the exposition of art
works linked to Jacques Lacan. Two feminists staged a protest in front of
Gustave Courbet’s The Origin of the World owned by Lacan; Deborah de
Robertis wrote “MeToo” on the painting which depicts a headless torso of a
sexually aroused naked woman’s body, focused on her hairy vulva. The title of
a predominant feminist reaction tells it all: “Hurrah for the Courbet vandals:
defacing the vulva painting is basic feminism”—de Robertis “is right to think
the painting is misogynistic: the model doesn’t even have a face!”8 But are
things really so clear and simple? While fully respecting the feminist objections
as well as rejecting the traditionalist academic disdain for de Robertis’s act,
I think things are more complex. Yes, there is a long history of women
dismembered by a (male) painter—recall A Woman Throwing a Stone (Picasso,
312                              Quantum History


1931): the distorted fragments of a woman on a beach throwing a stone9—
one should not forget that it was made by a male painter tearing apart a
woman’s body.
   So let’s begin with politics. Courbet was imprisoned for six months in 1871
for his involvement with the Paris Commune and lived in exile in Switzerland
from 1873 until his death four years later. As for the fact that the torso is
headless, we should remember that back in 2014, de Robertis already performed
a feminist act in Musee d’Orsay: in front of the same painting, she sat down
with her legs widely spread, fully exposing her vulva to the spectators.10 This
confrontation of the real displayed vagina with her fantasmatic double in a
painting produces the effect of “This is not a vagina,” like that of “This is not a
pipe” in the famous Magritte painting—the scene in which a real person is
shown side by side with the ultimate image of what she is in the fantasy for the
male Other. But is a woman really more “objectivized” when painted as a
headless torso?
   To grasp what is happening here, one should recall the paradigmatic hard-
core sexual position (and shot) which is easy to identify: the woman is lying on
her back with her legs spread wide backwards and with her knees above her
shoulder; the camera is in front, showing the man’s penis penetrating her
vagina (his face is as a rule invisible, he is reduced to an instrument), but what
we see in the background between her thighs is her face in the thrall of
orgasmic enjoyment. This minimal “reflexivity” is crucial: if we were just to see
the close-up of penetration, the scene would soon turn boring, disgusting
even, more of a medical showcase—one has to add the woman’s enthralled
gaze, the subjective reaction to what is going on. Furthermore, this gaze is as a
rule not addressed at her partner who is producing the supposed pleasure but
directly at us—we, the spectators, clearly play the role of the big Other who has
to register her enjoyment. The pivot of the scene is thus not male (her sexual
partner’s or the spectator’s) enjoyment: the spectator is reduced to a pure gaze,
the pivot is woman’s enjoyment (staged for the male gaze, of course). The sad
irony here is that the very fact that the woman is not “objectivized” but rendered
as a subject makes her humiliation worse: she has to fake her enjoyment. Being
compelled to enact fake subjective engagement is much worse than being
reduced to an object.

   So, back to the photo of the painting and the “real” de Robertis displaying
her vulva: the paradox is that, no matter what her intentions were, the real de
Robertis displaying her vulva is much closer to pornography than Courbet’s
painting precisely because her vulva is accompanied by her gaze (her head
looking at us), while the effect of Courbet’s painting is much more disturbing—
why, precisely? While it is not, of course, a feminist painting in any sense (it
clearly addresses a male gaze), it clearly renders the deadlock (or dead end) of
the traditional realist painting, whose ultimate object—never fully and directly
shown, but always hinted at, present as a kind of underlying point of reference—
was the naked and thoroughly sexualized feminine body as the ultimate object
of male desire and look. The exposed feminine body functioned here in a way
similar to the underlying reference to the sexual act in classic Hollywood, best
described in the famous instruction of the movie tycoon Monroe Stahr to his
scriptwriters from Scott Fitzgerald’s The Last Tycoon:

   At all times, at all moments when she is on the screen in our sight, she wants
   to sleep with Ken Willard. . . . Whatever she does, it is in place of sleeping
   with Ken Willard. If she walks down the street she is walking to sleep with
   Ken Willard, if she eats her food it is to give her enough strength to sleep
   with Ken Willard. But at no time do you give the impression that she would
   even consider sleeping with Ken Willard unless they were properly
   sanctified.

The exposed feminine body is thus the impossible object, it functions as the
ultimate horizon of representation whose disclosure is forever postponed—in
short, it functions as the Lacanian incestuous Thing. Its absence, the Void of
the Thing, is then filled in by “sublimated” images of beautiful, but not totally
exposed, feminine bodies, i.e., by bodies which always maintain a minimum of
distance towards That. But the crucial point (or, rather, the underlying illusion)
of the traditional painting is that the “true” incestuous naked body nonetheless
waits there to be discovered—in short, the illusion of traditional realism does
not reside in the faithful rendering of the depicted objects; it rather resides in
the belief that, behind the directly rendered objects, there effectively IS the
absolute Thing which could be possessed if we were only able to discard the
obstacles or prohibitions that prevent access to it.
314                              Quantum History


   We can read many pre-modern paintings as pointing towards the Thing
which remains off frame—suffice it to recall the (wrongly) so-called mystery of
Mona Lisa’s smile. I think it is a fake mystery—there is no secret behind
her smile. Its best explanation is provided by Slovene (my own) language—
every (honest) Slovene knows what the smile of Mona Lisa is about. Slovenes
do not have their own dirty words, they have to borrow them, mostly from
Serbo and Croat, but also from Italian. We know that “Mona” is a popular
Italian name for vagina, and “lisa” (pronounced “leeza”) is the root of the
Slovene verb “to lick”—Mona Lisa’s smile is the satisfied smile of getting a
gentle cunnilingus. There is a modern parodic painting The real Mona Lisa
which, I think, renders her quite appropriately in her stupid satisfaction after
the cunnilingus.
   What Courbet accomplished in his Origin is the gesture of radical
desublimation: he made the risky move and simply went all the way, directly
depicting what the previous realistic art was just hinting at as its withdrawn
point of reference—the outcome of this operation, of course, was the reversal
of the sublime object into abject, into an abhorring, nauseating excremental
piece of slime. This disgusting slime is not the “truth” of the sublime appearance:
true love is able to assert the identity of the two—here is a nice case of it. A
classic (not always) comic film scene is that of the (persecuted) hero finding
himself in front of a large audience, mistaken for another; he has to improvise
a talk about a topic of which he is wholly ignorant (Robert Donat in Hitchcock’s
39 steps, mistaken for a local politician, improvises an electoral speech; Joseph
Cotten in The Third Man, mistaken for a serious writer, answers questions
about James Joyce, etc.). The latest version occurs in Bean (directed by Mel
Smith, with Rowan Atkinson), in which Bean, a disastrously stupid low-level
employee of the English National Gallery, is sent to Los Angeles to present
Whistler’s portrait of his mother, bought by a rich local gallery from Musee
d’Orsay for 50 million dollars. Here is Bean’s short speech:

   Well, hello, I’m Dr Bean, apparently, and my job is to sit and look at paintings.
   (Applause) So what have I learnt that I can say about this painting? Well . . .
   Well, firstly, it’s quite big, which is excellent, because if it was really small,
   you know, microscopic, then hardly anybody would be able to see it, which
                                 The Painted Void                              315


   would be a tremendous shame. And secondly, and I’m getting quite near the
   end now of this analysis of this painting, secondly, why was it worth this
   man here spending 50 million of your American dollars on this portrait?
   And the answer is, well, this picture is worth such a lot of money because it’s
   a picture of Whistler’s mother, and as I’ve learnt by staying with my best
   friend, David Langley, and his family, families are very important, and even
   though Mr Whistler was perfectly aware that his mother was a hideous old
   bat who looked like she had a cactus lodged up her backside, he stuck with
   her and even took the time to paint this amazing picture of her. It’s not just
   a painting. It’s a picture of a mad old cow who he thought the world of, and
   that’s marvelous. Well, that’s what I think, anyway.

This speech is far from nonsense: it plays with the gap between the sublime
and the ridiculous, relying on the notion of true love as the ability to find the
sublime IN the ridiculous. This, however, is not Courbet’s line: Courbet
masterfully continued to dwell at the very blurred border that separates the
sublime from the excremental: the woman’s body in Origin retains its full
erotic attraction, yet it becomes repulsive precisely on account of this excessive
attraction. (Courbet painted also the head that belongs to the naked body in
Origin—a proof that he knew very well that the head should not be included
in the painting.) Courbet’s gesture is thus a dead end: the dead end of traditional
realist painting—but precisely as such, it is a necessary “mediator” between
traditional and modernist art, i.e., it stands for a gesture that had to be
accomplished if we are to “clear the ground” for the emergence of the modernist
“abstract” art. How?
   With Courbet, we learn that there is no Thing behind its sublime appearance,
that if we force our way through the sublime appearance to the Thing itself, all
we get is a suffocating nausea of the abject—so the only way to reestablish
the minimal structure of sublimation is to directly stage the void itself, the
Thing as the Void-Place-Frame, without the illusion that this Void is sustained
by some hidden incestuous Object. One can now understand in what precise
way, and paradoxical as it may sound, Malevitch’s Black Square as the seminal
painting of modernism is the true counterpoint to (or reversal of) Origin: in
Courbet, we get the incestuous Thing itself which threatens to implode the
316                              Quantum History


Clearing, the Void in which (sublime) objects (can) appear, while in Malevitch,
we get its exact opposite, the matrix of sublimation at its most elementary,
reduced to the bare marking of the distance between foreground and
background, between a wholly “abstract” object (square) and the Place that
contains it. The “abstraction” of the modernist painting is thus to be conceived
as a reaction to the over-presence of the ultimate “concrete” object, the
incestuous Thing, that turns it into a disgusting abject, i.e., that turns the
sublime into an excremental excess.
   Far from being a simple male-chauvinist depiction of the object of desire,
Courbet’s Origin thus confronts the male desire with its deadlock: what you
really desire is a headless monster, and it is your gaze (sustained by desire)
which decapitates the woman. The title of Courbet’s painting could have been a
version of Magritte’s “ita Ceci n’est pas une pipe”: “Ceci n’est pas une vagine!” In
French vagina is masculine (“le vagin”), so why feminize it? Vagina in feminine
(“la vagine”) is a part of the entire feminine body (head, legs and arms included),
while “le vagin” is not feminine but part of a headless monstrosity constructed
by masculine fantasy. “Ceci n’est pas une vagine” is thus quite literally true: what
we see on the painting is le vagin, so it should be “ceci est un vagin.”


                 Tristan’s Chord and his Death

One should not be surprised to see this same void of desire staged in what is
perhaps the first work that breaks the chains of classic tonality, Richard
Wagner’s Tristan. As we have already seen,11 the axiom of the analytic
interpretation holds that whenever a new Master-Signifier emerges and
structures a symbolic field, we must look for the absent centre excluded from
this field. Insofar as, in classical tonal music, the dominant plays a role similar
to the Master-Signifier, it is the Prelude to Tristan which brings out for the first
time the tension between multiple dominants (which are all absent, just
implied) in a way which uncannily resembles quantum superpositions.
Matthew Cord described perspicuously how, at its beginning,

   Wagner has made the key very clear from the outset, and you’ll wonder why.
   The first reason why is because we’re in a minor, but a minor is never stated
                                   The Painted Void                                317


   explicitly. What we’re given is the Tristan chord turning to the dominant
   seven of a minor, so that could go to a minor—it never does but it implies
   that the tonality is a minor. We don’t hear a minor, what we hear is the
   second phrase which takes us to C major. Well, we don’t hear that either but
   it is implied, and then finally the third phrase takes us to the dominant of e
   minor.12

So not only is the resolution of the tension in the dominant forever postponed,
not only does the dominant never directly appear, even this absent centre
constantly changes. From a purely musical standpoint, we could argue that we
get the resolution at Tristan’s very end, with the peace established by the
Liebestod. But do we really get it? Recall what is for me the definitive staging of
Tristan, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s Bayreuth version (conducted by Daniel
Barenboim in 1981, filmed in 1983): in Act III, Tristan dies alone (Isolde stayed
with her husband, King Marke, her appearance at the opera’s end is merely the
dying Tristan’s hallucination). The gap that prevents any resolution is here
staged as the tension between the resolution in music and the reality of what
we see on stage. Johanna Meier (the soprano who sang Isolde) reported about
this ending:

   Ponnelle imagined Isolde would never appear, but sing from the pit, which
   idea was not favoured by me, nor by Barenboim, nor by Wolfgang Wagner,
   so in the final week of rehearsal Ponnelle began experimenting with various
   possibilities. Isolde here, Isolde there, Isolde arrives early, Isolde arrives late,
   etc. . . . . The final staging was decided on Opening Night, when I was
   informed in my dressing room between the 2nd and 3rd Act which version
   we would do. This version was used in all three years of the production,
   although it has been erroneously reported both in reviews and books that
   Ponnelle’s first concept of Isolde singing from the pit was used.13

I think that while Ponnelle was playing with multiple superposed versions, his
solution was the correct one—it clearly demonstrates that in Tristan, the very
opera which elevates the lovers’ shared death into its explicit ideological goal,
this, precisely, is NOT what effectively happens. They approach this moment
in the duet at the end of Act II (“so stürben wir, um ungetrennt”—“so we are
318                              Quantum History


dying, undivided”), but their orgasmic self-annihilation is cut short first by the
warning of Brangaene and then by the brutal intrusion of King Marke. At the
opera’s end, they die one AFTER the other, each immersed in his/her own
solipsistic dream. Along these lines, one should read Isolde’s ecstatic death at
the end of Tristan as the ultimate operatic prosopopea: Tristan can only die if
his death is transposed onto Isolde. When Tristan repeats his claim that death
could not destroy their love, Isolde provides the concise formula of their death:
“But this little word ‘and’—if it were to be destroyed, how but through the loss
of Isolde’s own life could Tristan be taken by death?”—in short, it is only in and
through her death that he will be able to die.
   Does Wagner’s Tristan not then offer an example of the interpassivity of
death itself, of the “subject supposed to die”? Tristan can only die insofar as
Isolde experiences the full bliss of the lethal self-obliteration for him, in his
place. In other words, what “really happens” in Act III of Tristan is only Tristan’s
long “voyage to the bottom of the night” with regard to which Isolde’s death is
Tristan’s own fantasmatic supplement, the delirious construction that enables
him to die in peace. Isolde’s final appearance and ecstatic death in Tristan is the
hallucination of the dying Tristan, so that the entire Act III, inclusive of the
ending, is Tristan’s monologue. Thomas May wrote about the long monologue
of the dying Tristan:

   As the music heats up to the fever pitch in his staggered states of delirium,
   its excitement evokes nothing of the erotic character heard earlier in the
   drama. Its depiction of an emptiness at the core of desire is nothing short of
   terrifying, and this very realization fuels Tristan’s suffering. This is what the
   word passion after all signifies in its root meaning.14

Ponnelle brings out this “emptiness at the core of desire” in a painfully-palpable
way: when Isolde stops singing her Liebestod, the entire stage is enveloped in
darkness for a couple of seconds, and then (a much weaker and greyish) light
returns, showing the dead Tristan alone under the gigantic dead tree. Moreover,
Isolde did not appear to the dying Tristan: she appears as an extra-bright
hallucination behind his back. Tristan looks at us, the spectators, as if he sees
Isolde in our gaze.15 As in hardcore porn, we—the spectators—are reduced to
a pure gaze, and the pivot is woman’s enjoyment (here Isolde’s ecstatic death)
                                 The Painted Void                             319


staged for the male gaze, but in a more complex way: a man (Tristan) sees the
gaze seeing her dying. After Isolde disappears we see the dead Tristan deprived
of all fantasmatic support, alone as he always was in the emptiness of his desire.
Note that Isolde appears to the dying Tristan in the void that separates the two
stems of the gigantic tree—the void which corresponds to the void that
separates the two houses in Wyeth’s painting, making the parallel between
Christina and the dying Tristan perfect.

                         Variation 7
            The many monsters
              of the cinema


Not only is appearance inherent to reality; what we get beyond reality is a
weird split in appearance itself, an unheard-of mode designating “the way
things really appear to us” as opposed to both their reality and their (direct)
appearance to us. This shift from the split between appearance and reality to
the split, inherent to appearance itself, between “true” and “false” appearance, is
to be linked to its obverse, to a split inherent to reality itself. If, then, there is
appearance (as distinct from reality) because there is a (logically) prior split
inherent to reality itself, is it also that “reality” itself is ultimately nothing but a
(self-)split of the appearance? However, how does this topos differ from the old
boring Rashomon-motif of an irreducible multiplicity of the subjective
perspectives on reality, with no way (no exempted position from which) to
establish the one truth represented in a distorted way by these multiple
perspectives?



                          The East: Rashomon

What better way to clarify this point than to refer to the very film (and the
short story on which the film is based) whose title was elevated into a trope,
Akira Kurosava’s Rashomon? As the legend goes, it was through Rashomon that
the Western public in the early 1950s discovered the “Oriental spirit” in cinema;


                                                                                    321
322                                Quantum History


the lesser-known obverse of this legend is that Rashomon was a failure in Japan
itself where it was perceived as all too “Western”—and one can well see why.
When the same tragic event (in a lone forest, a well-known bandit rapes the
samurai’s beautiful wife and kills the samurai) is retold by four witnesses-
participants, the effect (pertaining to the very Western realism of the cinematic
image) is simply that we are told four different subjective perspectives.
However, what effectively distinguishes the so-called “Oriental spirit” from the
Western attitude is that, precisely, ambiguity and indecidability are not
“subjectivized”: they should not be reduced to different “subjective perspectives”
on some reality beyond reach—they rather pertain to this “reality” itself, and
it is this ontological ambiguity-fragility of the “thing itself ” that it is difficult to
render through the realism of the cinematic medium. What this means is that
the authentic “rashomon” has nothing to do with the pseudo-Nietzschean
perspectivism, with the notion that there is no objective truth, just an
irreducible multitude of subjectively distorted-biased narratives.
                                     *
The first thing to do apropos Rashomon is to avoid the formalist trap: what one
is tempted to call the film’s formal-ontological thesis (the impossibility to
arrive at truth from multiple narratives of the same event) should NOT be
abstracted from the particular nature of this event—the feminine challenge to
the male authority, the explosion of feminine desire. The four witness-reports
are to be conceived as four versions of the same myth (in the Levi-Straussian
sense of the term), as a complete matrix of variations: in the first (bandit’s)
version, he raped the wife and then, in an honest duel, killed her husband; in
the second (surviving’s wife’s) version, in the course of the rape, she got caught
up in the passion of the bandit’s forceful love-making and, at the end, tells him
that she cannot live in shame with both the men knowing about her disgrace—
one of them should die, and it is then that the duel ensues; in the third version
(told by the ghost of the dead husband himself), after the husband is set free by
the bandit, he stabs and kills himself out of shame; in the last version, told by
the woodcutter who observed the events hidden in a nearby bush, when, after
the rape, the bandit cuts the rope tying the husband, and the husband furiously
rejects his wife calling her a dishonored whore, the ecstatically furious wife
explodes against both men, reproaching them with weakness and challenging
                         The Many Monsters of the Cinema                      323


them to fight for her. The succession of the four versions is thus not neutral,
they do not all move at the same level: in the course of their progression, the
male authority is step by step weakened and the feminine desire asserted. So
when we privilege the last (woodcutter’s) report, the point is not that it tells
what “truly happened,” but that, within the immanent structure that links the
four versions, it functions as the traumatic point with regard to which the
other three versions are to be conceived as defenses, defense-formations.
   The “official” message of the film is clear enough: at the very beginning, in
the conversation that provides the frame for the flashbacks, the monk points
out that the lesson of the events recounted is more terrifying than the hunger,
war, and chaos that pervaded society at that time—in what does this horror
reside? In the disintegration of the social link: there was no “big Other” on
which people could rely, no basic symbolic pact guaranteeing trust and
sustaining obligations. The film is thus not engaged in ontological games about
how there is no ultimate unambiguous reality behind the multitude of
narratives; it is rather concerned with the socio-ethical consequences of the
disintegration of the basic symbolic pact that holds the social fabric together.
However, the story—the incident retold from different perspectives—tells
more: it locates the threat to the big Other, the ultimate cause that destabilizes
the male pact and blurs the clarity of the male vision of a woman, of feminine
desire. As already Nietzsche put it: in its very inconsistency and lack of any
ultimate point of reference beneath multiple veils, truth is feminine.



              The East: Monsters, Handmaiden

There are clear indications that the so-called Oriental spirituality, especially
that of Japan and South Korea, provides a privileged site of superpositions in
cinema. The definitive movie about superpositions is without doubt Monsters
(Hirokazu Kore-Eda, Japan, 2023)—here is the outline of the story. Saori
Mugino, a single mother, is raising her fifth-grade son Minato who begins
exhibiting strange behaviour (cutting his own hair, coming home with only
one shoe). One night, Minato does not come home at all and after calling
around, Saori finds him in an abandoned train tunnel. Saori begins to suspect
324                              Quantum History


her son’s teacher, Hori, is abusing him and confronts the school about it. She is
treated coldly by the faculty, culminating in Hori making a disingenuous
apology. When she confronts Hori directly, he asserts that Minato is actually
bullying another student named Yori. Saori visits Yori’s house and discovers
that Yori, despite his strange behaviour, is fond of and concerned for Minato.
Hori is eventually fired from the school, but returns there days later; Minato
falls down a flight of stairs trying to escape from him. Hori later comes to Saori
and Minato’s house during a rain storm, but Minato has gone missing. At this
point, a flashback returns to the beginning of the film from Hori’s point of
view. He notices Minato exhibiting disruptive behaviour, such as throwing
other students’ belongings around the classroom and seemingly locking Yori in
a bathroom stall. Hori too visits Yori’s house, where he discovers that his father,
Kiyotaka, is an abusive alcoholic. When Saori begins inquiring about her son,
the faculty requires Hori to resign. Hori returns to the school to confront
Minato, and contemplates jumping from the roof. Back at home, Hori notices
a pattern in Yori’s old homework that seems to spell out Minato’s name.
Realizing the two boys were actually in love, Hori rushes to the Mugino
household to apologize. When Saori tells him Minato is missing, they go to the
train tunnel to find him. They find an abandoned railcar nearly buried in mud,
but only see Minato’s poncho inside. The final flashback begins from Minato’s
point of view. Yori plays with Minato’s hair, which the latter then impulsively
cuts off. The two boys grow close and Minato begins defending him from other
bullies, which Hori confuses for bullying. As the two become closer, Minato is
distressed that his feelings are becoming romantic and that he is not a worthy
son to his father. One night when he goes to Yori’s house, Yori and Kiyotaka
declare that Yori has been “cured,” though Yori quickly recants, which incites
his father’s wrath. During the rainstorm, Minato finds Yori fully clothed in his
bathtub, covered in bruises, and the two escape to the abandoned railcar, which
has become their hideout. After the rain subsides, they emerge from the bottom
of the railcar and question whether they have been reborn, and run through a
field together.1
   Monsters is a movie about neighbours in the strict Judeo-Christian meaning
of the term. One should clearly distinguish “neighbour” from merely a fellow
man: fellow men are those who are like us, we immediately recognize in them
                           The Many Monsters of the Cinema                    325


the common ground that we share. Fellow men are friends, members of my
family, co-workers, those whom I think I know intimately. A fellow man
transforms himself into a neighbour when I detect in him a feature or a gesture
which makes him a total strangers to me: “How could he do THAT? I never
expected this from him. Is he one of us at all or an alien monster?” It is on
account of this monstrosity of the neighbour that Lacan applies to the neighbour
the term Thing (das Ding), used by Freud to designate the ultimate object of our
desires in its unbearable intensity and impenetrability. One should hear in this
term all the connotations of horror fiction: the neighbour is the (Evil) Thing
which potentially lurks beneath every homely human face. Just think about
Stephen King’s The Shining, in which the father, a modest failed writer, gradually
turns into a killing beast who, with an evil grin, goes on to slaughter his entire
family. But a neighbour can also imply an unexpected positive surprise: a fellow
man whom we considered just an ordinary person with all its weaknesses
becomes a neighbour when he displays an unexpected courage or honesty.
   In Monsters, we see how, first, Minato becomes a monster for his mother
due to his weird acts, and to account for his weird acts and simultaneously
de-monstrify Minato, she projects monstrosity onto his teacher Hori. In the
first flashback, Hori is de-monstrified: we see him from his own standpoint as
a modest and compassionate teacher who perceives a monstrosity in Minato,
but is then compelled to see the inner tension of Minato who is not able to
come to terms with his affection towards Yori. The interest of the film resides
in the fact that it repeatedly performs the operation that is the exact opposite
of a fellow man becoming a monstrous neighbour: when we shift the
perspective to the inner experience of the monster him/herself, we see s/he is
really a fellow man like us . . .
   The obvious lesson of the film is that the ultimate monster is the patriarchal
order itself, and for that reason, the only person who remains a monster is
Kiyotaka, Yori’s abusive and alcoholic father who wants to brutally
“renormalize” his son and make him act as befits a boy—we never see the
other side of his character that would made him more sympathetic since he is
reduced to a ridiculous embodiment of the patriarchal stance. This fact
indicates the limit of the film’s ideological coordinates: the opposition of
patriarchal culture and gay love is unconditional, there is no process of
326                              Quantum History


de-monstrification of patriarchy and of monstrification of gay love in this
universe. (One should add here that the couple is not yet sexualized, so that
the love of the two boys is asexual—a further compromise, because the asexual
character of their love makes this love pure and innocent. Sexualization always
implicates duplicity, deceit and a kind of monstrosity.)
   The multiple standpoints of the film’s narrative—flashbacks make us see the
same events in a different light—are a strategy to de-monstrify someone who
is perceived/constructed in the eyes of the others as a monster. What I find
problematic here is the underlying premise which comes close to the utter
fatuity masquerading as a deep wisdom: “An enemy is someone whose story
you have not heard.”2 Are we also ready to affirm that Hitler was our enemy
only because his story was not heard? Is it not that the more I know about and
“understand” Hitler, the more Hitler is my enemy? Not to mention the fact that
stories we are telling to ourselves are as a rule a lie manufactured to justify the
horrors I am doing to others—the truth is out there, in what we are doing in
reality. Every aggressor presents itself as a victim reacting to an aggression.
That’s why my motto is “no ethnic cleansing without poetry,” that’s why wars
are sustained not only by an industrial-military complex but also by what one
should call the poetic-military complex. We saw this complex at work in the
post-Yugoslav war in the early 1990s, but to avoid the illusion that the poetic-
military complex is a Balkan specialty, one should mention at least Hassan
Ngeze who, in his journal Kangura, was systematically spreading anti-Tutsi
hatred and calling for their genocide.
   The predominance of religiously (or ethnically) justified violence can be
accounted for by the very fact that we live in an era that perceives itself as post-
ideological. The large majority of people are spontaneously “moral”: killing
another human being is deeply traumatic for them. So, in order to make them
do it, a larger “sacred” Cause is needed, which makes petty individual concerns
about killing seem trivial. Religion or ethnic belonging fit this role perfectly. Of
course there are cases of pathological atheists who are able to commit mass
murder just for pleasure, just for the sake of it, but they are rare exceptions. The
majority needs to be “anaesthetized” against their elementary sensitivity to the
other’s suffering. For this, a sacred Cause is needed. More than a century ago,
in his Brothers Karamazov, Dostoyevsky warned against the dangers of godless
                         The Many Monsters of the Cinema                       327


moral nihilism: “If God doesn’t exist, then everything is permitted.” The lesson of
today’s terrorism is, on the contrary, that if there is a God, then everything,
even blowing up hundreds of innocent bystanders, is permitted to those who
claim to act directly on behalf of God, as the instruments of His will, since,
clearly, a direct link to God justifies our violation of any “merely human”
constraints and considerations. The “godless” Stalinist Communists are the
ultimate proof of it: everything was permitted to them since they perceived
themselves as direct instruments of their divinity, the Historical Necessity of
Progress towards Communism. Religious ideologists usually claim that, true
or not, religion makes some otherwise bad people do some good things; from
today’s experience, one should rather stick to Steven Weinberg’s claim that,
while, without religion, good people would have been doing good things and
bad people bad things, only religion can make good people do bad things.
   This is why the shifting perspectives in Monsters tell only half of the story.
In the film, all characters (except Kiyotaka) are ethically rehabilitated when we
hear their side of the story; even the headmistress of the school who treats
Saori in a polite but brutally-dismissive way, ignoring her pain, is rehabilitated
when we learn about the tragic accident that ruined her life. But one should
still insist that this inner experience of trauma in no way justifies her brutal
treatment of Saori: whatever her inner experience, the truth is that she
acted in an ethically unacceptable way—or, in quantum mechanics terms, a
superposition of two stances irreducibly marks her life.
   There are some unexpected parallels between Monsters and The Handmaiden,
Park Chan-wook’s 2016 South Korean movie based on Sarah Waters’
Fingersmith, a 2002 novel with a similar plot set in Victorian time which, prior
to Chan-wook’s movie, was already twice adapted: a BBC TV adaptation in
2005 and a stage adaptation in 2015. The Handmaiden also uses shifting
perspectives (the same event, depicted from a different perspective, appears in
a wholly new light), plus it praises homosexual (here lesbian) sexuality as
resistance against violent patriarchy; the difference is here that same-sex love
is here fully sexualized (some critics accused the film of getting too close to
pornography), not just a pre-sexual gentle feeling of affection (as is the case in
Monsters). What makes the movie interesting is that its shifts of perspective
work in the opposite direction with regard to Monsters: the two women who
328                              Quantum History


first appear as naïvely-innocent are revealed to be involved in almost
diabolically-evil plots (their naïvety was a fake), while the two main masculine
persons are from the beginning presented as almost ridiculously evil, and in
the course of the film their evil gradually gets even more diabolical. (There is
no radical shift of perspective here, no other view that would at least partially
justify their acts—to make a more general point, it is as if there are not enough
flashbacks here, not enough shifts of standpoint.) It goes without saying that
toxic masculinity is exploding all around the world, not only in new Right’s
male chauvinism in the “developed” West but also in Africa: in Kenya, the
manosphere—a brutal polemics against the kind of behaviour deemed to
devalue a man’s worth, thereby making him a “simp”—is exploding in the last
years. “Simp” means being overly submissive or attentive to women or begging
or nagging for a woman’s attention after rejection, and any men seeking
validation from women through excessive or demeaning actions, such as
apologizing or proposing marriage; such a stance should be opposed by proud
assertion: “I’m an alpha male, you can’t speak to me like this. I need to be
treated like a king.” Amerix, the main proponent of the manosphere, is also
well known for his advocacy of fertility and men’s health, often emphasizing
diet, virility and the belief that men, especially Africans, should have many
children.3 However, one should add that, in all such cases, the manosphere is
not a true display of strength but a clear sign of weakness and panic.
   What redeems the two women is that, although each of the two is involved in
a deadly plot against the other, they fall passionately in love with each other, and
this love allows them to exit the vicious cycle of evil, while the two men both
end up dead. One has to add here that the way the two women exit the circle of
male domination is no less criminal—they both act in a brutal manipulative
way against others. The world we end up in The Handmaiden is thus a world of
global violence, manipulation and exploitation: there is no way out of it, the
escape of the two women is limited to their sexual intimacy, while in their
relations to others they fully remain within the world of corrupted manipulation.
What if they—the two woman—are the paradigmatic subjects of our time (with
“authentic” intimate experience somehow justifying their social behaviour),
while one of the men at least (the fake “Count”) is much more honest in his
open admission of total corruption not justified by any inner authenticity?
                          The Many Monsters of the Cinema                        329


   Surprisingly (or not so), this brings us back to our first case, Rashomon. As
we have already seen, the succession of the four versions is not neutral: in the
course of their progression, the male authority is step by step weakened and
the feminine desire asserted. This brings us to Lacan and his theory of feminine
sexuality (and subjectivity): the multiplicity of superpositions is not a formal
scheme indifferent with regard to sexual difference. The (irreducible)
multiplicity of superpositions is as such, in itself, feminine, and its collapse into
a single point is masculine. This in no way implies that femininity is reduced to
a confusing ground which is magically turned into a single consistent order
through the intervention of a masculine Master-Signifier (Sl)—quite on the
contrary, the imposition of a single Master-Signifier obfuscates the multiplicity
of Master-Signifiers themselves.



     The East in the West: Romance Sentimentale


The very first episode of the first season of The Twilight Zone begins with a
man who finds himself walking down a country road, not knowing who, nor
where he is. He comes across a diner with a jukebox blaring and hot coffee on
the stove—only no one’s there. A little further down the road, he comes to the
picturesque town of Oakwood, and finds it, too, seems deserted. The only
sounds he hears are a clock tower and a pay phone ringing. At the local movie
theater, an ad for Battle Hymn leads him to believe he’s in the Air Force. In spite
of there being no people to be found, he can’t shake off the feeling that he’s
being watched. Finally he realizes that his experience in Oakwood was his
hallucination—he is actually in an isolation booth being observed by a group
of uniformed servicemen. He has been undergoing tests to determine his
fitness as an astronaut and whether he can handle a prolonged trip to the
Moon alone; the town was an hallucination caused by sensory deprivation.4
While watching this episode (and not knowing the final twist), I was expecting
a different final turn (remember that the episode was shot in 1958, in the midst
of the Cold War): a nuclear bomb explodes above the empty Oakwood and
totally destroys it—the man finds himself in a fake empty city which was
330                              Quantum History


constructed by the US Army to test how much and what kind of destruction is
caused by a nuclear explosion . . . The fact that he is a military pilot explains
how he found himself at this spot: USA Army effectively made such experiments
in the 1950s. My point is that we have here a genuine superposition: for a
typical TV spectator at that time the testing of the effects of a nuclear explosion
was a much more credible event. It is thus a safe presupposition that this
version was the first that popped up in the minds of the TV spectators, and the
creators of the episode were fully aware of this and were counting on it: the
final twist only works because it avoids the superposed different twist.
   This brings us to the second axiom of the analytic interpretation: the
excluded dimension inscribes itself into the form of a work of art in its excess
over its content, which is why for a Marxist the truth of an event or work resides
in its form itself. Take George Orwell’s Animal Farm: the story is obviously an
account of how the October Revolution regressed into Stalinism. However, let’s
imagine that we would re-translate the story about animals rebelling against
humans into a direct realist story about exploited humans rebelling against
their masters, the result of their rebellion being an even worse tyranny—what
we would get is a totally boring and predictable story without any artistic or
political interest. All the libidinal charm comes from replacing humans with
animals (the new nomenklatura are pigs, etc.). Animals are not just a metaphor:
they confer on the story about a human rebellion a specific flavour.
   Let’s complicate this dialectic between form and content even further by
another unexpected example. Sergei Eisenstein’s and Grigori Aleksandrov’s
Romance Sentimentale (1930)5, a 20-minute movie accompanied by music, is
arguably the point of exception (and as such the symptomal point) in
Eisenstein’s entire work. In 1930, when Eisenstein and Aleksandrov found
themselves on a tour of Western Europe before moving to the US and Mexico,
a rich French businessman invited them to do a short film dedicated to his
mistress who was also to star in it; Eisenstein and Aleksandrov accepted the
task and quickly made a 20-minutes long “romance sentimentale” whose title
perfectly fits the content. No wonder Eisenstein later not only disavowed the
film but even denied having anything to do with it (Louis Bunuel, who at that
time worked in the same Paris studio in which Eisenstein and Aleksandrov did
their romance, confirmed it was their work).
                         The Many Monsters of the Cinema                     331


   One can easily understand the reason for Eisenstein’s shame: the film
demonstrates how his “revolutionary” procedure of montage of attractions can
be used without any problem to film a “sentimental romance,” the very epitome
of bourgeois ideology. It is as if, in Romance Sentimentale, Eisenstein traversed
the path from Grail to cream separator in the opposite direction. That is to say,
in his remarks on the Jesuit techniques of meditation, he elaborated how the
procedure which, according to Loyola, enables us to attend ecstatic contact
with god can also be mobilized to attend ecstatic revolutionary engagement.
The most famous example is the cream separator scene from The Old and
the New in which the protagonist Marfa experiences a moment of pure bliss
while, kneeling before the cream separator, she observes how the flow
of cream begins to flow out of it. Eisenstein strives here to infuse the idea of
collectivization and technological progress with the fervour of the “ecstasy of
economics,” i.e., to discern in the impact of elementary agricultural technology
a properly religious ecstasy. In Romance Sentimentale, on the contrary, the
procedure of generating ecstatic revolutionary fervour is used to give rise to
moribund romantic sentimentality. In the first case, ideological ecstasy is
reduced to its material base (production process), while in the second case,
revolutionary material practice is used as a tool of ideological mystification.
   Upon a closer look, however, we can see how things get more complex.
Romance Sentimentale is composed of four parts. The first part (ca. 5 minutes)
is a pure exercise in montage of fragments destined to render what Deleuze
would have called pure impersonal intensity: turbulent nature, waves crushing,
trees falling, hectic forward movement, etc., accompanied by fragmentary
modern music (even some siren sounds), gradually slowing down and passing
into the melody of the elegiac love song. The turbulent passion is pacified,
burns out, in the second (longest) part; we find ourselves in an opulent dark
room where a lady—the heroine—stands at a window and then sits behind a
black piano and sings the song, the “sentimental romance.” So the first part is
the objective correlate which renders—what? Not the heroine’s inner state at
the time when we see her (in the second part) but her state of excitement when
her passionate affair was still going on. It is, we can surmise, done in an
impersonal way because it is something too strong and intense to be
subjectivized by her. In the third part passionate confusion returns as a
332                               Quantum History


renewed erotic explosion, but structured in a different way—subjectivized, a
mixture of dynamic fragments, clock, a dog, stills of Rodin’s statue of lovers
combined in montage cuts that generate the impression of movements (as
with the Czar’s statue falling down in October), with an almost ridiculous
drawn star exploding . . . all this against the same background of the heroine
sitting behind a piano in darkness. The part ends with return to sadness, with
the lady behind the piano in a dark night. Fade out—fade in to the last shortest
part, morning sun, brightness, bursting flowers, interchanged with the heroine
now in white behind a white piano, singing (the same song) in happiness, in an
almost kitschy way . . .
   If, then, the impersonal libidinal intensity of part 1 passes into the
melancholic calm song of part 2, why does the subjectivized libidinal intensity
of part 3 pass into a short vision of happiness where the same song is performed
in the opposite mood? Is it simply that non-subjectivized intensity leaves the
subject at a distance, unable to assume it, and therefore in a melancholic mood
of loss, while subjectivized libidinal intensity brings happiness? I think the
opposite is true: we can enjoy ourselves only when the fundamental crazy
dance of fantasies is kept at a distance, which is why melancholy, melancholic
loss, is the only way to sustain the core of enjoyment. When this core engulfs
us, our subjectivity dissolves, we turn into living dead. Here one should note a
crucial detail: in Eisenstein’s film the passage from part 3 to part 4 is a clear cut
indicated by the fade out and fade in. After this cut we enter another
dimension—her white dress and the white piano signal that she is dead.
   The lesson of this very basic interpretation is nonetheless an important
one: although we are dealing with a kind of Greimasian semiotic square of
four stances, all four are not at the same level, they do not operate within
the same space. The fourth position is an impossible one, it stands for nothing,
for obliteration of the subject, and the white-coloured part just fills in the gap
of this void. This is why one should not dismiss this short film just as a
commercial compromise: it brings out something that remains repressed in
the “revolutionary” political use of Eisenstein’s procedure: the impossibility
to sustain the full subjective assumption of libidinal madness—the moment I
do it, I obliterate myself. In other words, while the first three parts are focused
on the heroine, part four is our own (viewer’s) dream, totally disconnected
                          The Many Monsters of the Cinema                        333


from the heroine, our own kitschy projection of a happy ending onto her
disappearance.

                                       Part 4
                             (subjective destitution)


What we get here is not a linear progress from 1 to 4 but a 3 + 1: a pseudo-
Hegelian triad supplemented by a radically heterogeneous fourth term. We
begin with non-subjectivized libidinal intensity which is then negated by a
melancholic subject unable to appropriate/subjectivize it, and what follows is a
“synthesis,” an attempt of the subject to subjectivize/assume libidinal intensity.
However, this “synthesis” fails, the subject pays the price for its risky assumption
of libidinal intensity by its self-obliteration. However, the subject beneath the
bar of impossibility is not simply dead, it survives what Lacan calls subjective
destitution and emerges as a living dead, the pure void of subject deprived of
its subjectivity, a subject who is no longer a person.

       Sexual superpositions


According to the popular (mis)conception of psychoanalysis, sex (the sexual
relationship) serves as the ultimate reference of all our activities: everything
we do and feel has a sexual connotation. Along these lines, one is tempted to
rewrite the entire history of modern philosophy:

  – Descartes: “I fuck, therefore I am,” i.e., only in the intense sexual
      activity do I experience the fullness of my being (Lacan’s “decentering”
      answer to it would have been: “I fuck where I am not, and I am not
      where I fuck,” i.e., it is not me who is fucking, but “it fucks” in me);
  – Spinoza: within the Absolute as Fuck (coitus sive natura), one should
      distinguish, along the lines of the distinction between natura
      naturans and natura naturata, between the active fucking penetration
      and the object being fucked—there are those who fuck and those who
      get fucked;
  – Hume introduces here the empiricist doubt: how do we know that fuck
      as a relationship exists at all? There are just objects whose movements
      appear coordinated;
  – Kant responds to this crisis: “the conditions of possibility of fucking
      are at the same time the conditions of possibility of the objects of
      fucking”;
  – Fichte then radicalizes this Kantian revolution: fucking is a self-
      positing unconditional activity which divides itself into fucker and
      the fucked object, i.e., it is fucking itself which posits its object, the
      fuckee;

                                                                                   335
336                             Quantum History


   – Hegel: “it is crucial to conceive Fucking not only as Substance (the
      substantial drive overwhelming us), but also as Subject (as a reflective
      activity embedded in the context of spiritual meaning)”;
   – Marx: one should return to real fucking against the idealist
      masturbatory philosophising, i.e., as he literally put it in German
      Ideology, real, actual life is to philosophy as real sex is to masturbation;
   – Nietzsche: the Will is, at its most radical, the Will to Fuck, which
      culminates in the Eternal Return of “I want more,” of a fuck going on
      forever;
   – Heidegger: in the same way as the essence of technology is nothing
      “technological,” the essence of fucking has nothing to do with fuck as a
      simple ontic activity; rather, “the essence of fucking is the fucking of
      the Essence itself,” i.e., it is not only we, humans, that fuck up our
      understanding of Essence, it is the Essence which is already in itself
      fucked up (inconsistent, withdrawing itself, erring);
   – and, finally, this insight into how the Essence itself is fucked up, brings
      us to Lacan’s “there is no such thing as a sexual relationship.”

Heidegger’s and Lacan’s “pessimist” reversal of Nietzsche’s Eternal Return of a
fuck going on forever is actually a happy one. Recall the key turn in Hamlet’s
“To be or not to be” soliloquy: “To die, to sleep, To sleep, perchance to Dream;
aye, there’s the rub, For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, When
we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.” So let’s go to the end
and imagine the most terrifying eternal dream: to fuck endlessly, without
interruption, without any chance of escape. At the end of this soliloquy, when
Hamlet says to Ophelia whom he sees reading a religious book: “Nymph, in thy
orisons [prayers] be all my sins remembered,” he is basically asking her to pray
for him and for the forgiveness of his sins. What Lacan means by “there is no
big Other” is precisely that there is no place where all Hamlet’s sins are
remembered, nor mine, which means that they cannot be obliterated—they
will haunt me forever.
   Furthermore, if there is no big Other, we also have to abandon the idea of
sexuality as the ultimate reference of all that we say and do. We have to do this
if we want to be true dialectical materialists: the notion of “pan-sexism” is
                               Sexual Superpositions                            337


clearly non-dialectical, it is a mechanic-materialist thesis. In quantum terms,
sexuality is immanently crossed by detours and displacements, and these
detours and displacements evoke the topic of superpositions—so what can the
quantum approach tell us about sexuality? The first obvious implication is that
we should replace the rather boring topic of sexual positions (how to do the
sexual act, what positions bodies should assume) with the topic of sexual
superpositions. How is a sexual identity formed? It (mostly) “collapses” into a
particular form (gay, hetero, lesbian . . .), but to understand how this form
emerged we have to accept that the subject in their fantasies played with many
possible forms, and that these multiple and inconsistent “superposed” forms
continue to echo in the final form.1
   The main source of these superposed fantasies is so-called infantile sexuality,
and the basic insight of psychoanalysis is that, even if a subject finally adopts a
single “mature” sexual identity, infantile sexual fantasies do not disappear but
continue to serve as a fantasy support of the “actual” sexual activity. This
conclusion clearly follows Freudian orthodoxy: the basic premise of his Three
Essays on Sexuality (1905) is that perversions exist in normal people also, in
multiple deviations of sexual aims, as well as in the tendency to linger over
preparatory sexual aspects such as looking and touching. Then there are
situations in which someone acts as if they are sincerely attracted to another
person, but in reality they act like this in order to be in contact with someone
close to this person—say, I regularly visit an older professor and engage in
passionate debates with him, but in reality I do this just to be close to his
daughter who lives with him and with whom I am passionately in love . . . But
what about the opposite situation: I say to myself that I tolerate talking to her
father while in reality I enjoy talking to her father more than being close to
her? In this case, pretending (to enjoy talking to her father) is not a lie covering
my real intention—the lie is the very act of pretending to like what I really like.
Pretending is thus redoubled, reflected into itself: I don’t just pretend, I pretend
to pretend. From here it is just a short step towards perversion: in perversion I
don’t just pretend to pretend, I openly focus on what is supposed to be just a
detour, a foreplay to the main event—say, in sexuality, I endlessly postpone the
act proper and remain at the level of caressing other parts of the body . . . Freud
formalized the distinction between the “fore-pleasures” of infantile sexuality
338                              Quantum History


and the “end-pleasure” of sexual intercourse; children have sexual urges,
from which adult sexuality only gradually emerges via psychosexual
development. So

   a disposition to perversions is an original and universal disposition of the
   human sexual instinct and . . . this postulated constitution, containing the
   germs of all the perversions, will only be demonstrable in children.2

This can be taken a step further: we (some of us) arrive at the heterosexual
norm only through deviations, and this path through deviations is not an
organic “natural” process but a process of brutal symbolic cuts, prohibitions
and impositions. This is the basic paradox of human sexuality: what appears as
a “natural” sexual orientation, the way in which reproduction (the biological
function of copulation) happens, is the final outcome of a complex socio-
symbolic process. The “progress” from infantile sexuality to the heterosexual
norm is not the process which follows a pattern of natural development. What,
then, is so scandalous about infantile sexuality? It is not the sole fact that even
children, presumed innocent, are already sexualized. The scandal resides in
two features (which are, of course, two sides of the same coin). First, infantile
sexuality is a weird entity which is neither biological(ly grounded) nor part of
symbolic/cultural norms. Jean Laplanche elaborated this weirdness when he
shows how the Freudian topic of seduction effectively reproduces the precise
structure of a Kantian antinomy. On the one hand, there is the brutal empirical
realism of parental sexual abuse: the ultimate cause of many later traumas and
pathologies is that children effectively have been groomed and abused by
adults; on the other hand, there is the (in)famous reduction of the abuse scene
to the patient’s fantasy. As Laplanche points out, the ultimate irony is that
dismissing sexual abuse as fantasy often passes for the “realistic” stance, while
those who insist on its reality sometimes end up identifying all kinds of abuse,
up to and including satanic rites and extra-terrestrial harassments . . .
Laplanche’s solution is precisely the transcendental one: while what he refers
to as “seduction” cannot be reduced to the subject’s fantasy, while it does refer
to a traumatic encounter of the other’s “enigmatic message,” bearing witness to
the other’s unconscious, it also cannot be reduced to an event in the reality of
the actual interaction between a child and adults. “Seduction” is rather a kind
                                Sexual Superpositions                             339


of transcendental structure, the minimal a priori formal constellation of the
child confronted with the impenetrable acts of the Other which bear witness
to the Other’s unconscious—and we are never dealing here with simple “facts,”
but always with facts located into the space of indeterminacy between “too
soon” and “too late”: the child is originally helpless, thrown into the world
when unable to take care of itself, i.e., their survival skills develop too late; at
the same time, the encounter of the sexualized Other always, by a structural
necessity, comes “too soon,” as an unexpected shock which cannot ever be
properly symbolized, translated into the universe of meaning.3 The fact of
“seduction” is thus again that of the Kantian transcendental X, a structurally-
necessary transcendental illusion . . . However, this excess, this weirdness, is
not sublated by adult “normal” sexuality—this latter also is always distorted,
displaced:

   when it comes to sexuality, man is subject to the greatest of paradoxes: what
   is acquired through the drives precedes what is innate and instinctual, in
   such a way that, at the time it emerges, instinctual sexuality, which is
   adaptive, finds the seat already taken, as it were, by infantile drives, already
   and always present in the unconscious.4

The “natural” form is the outcome of a complex symbolic process: the starting
point (infantile sexuality) is not yet fully “cultural,” but it is also not “natural,”
so that perversions (whose model is infantile sexuality) do not simply
disappear, they are not simply left behind in normal adult heterosexuality.
They remain in the form of kissing, touching, and the eroticization of
non-sexual parts of the body: “normal” sexuality erotically works only through
the shadows and remainders of these elements, otherwise it is just raw coupling,
like the insemination in Handmaid’s Tale. Perverse “deviations” are thus
necessary, we arrive at the norm only through them, so that (to put it in
Hegelian terms) what appears as “the norm” is the ultimate self-sublated
perversion. We encounter here what Hegel called “absolute recoil”: as deviations
from the Norm, perversions presuppose the norm, the pleasure they generate
resides in the transgression of the Norm; however, this Norm itself arises
through deviations, as the ultimate deviation. In other words, the very process
of deviation retroactively constructs what it deviates from, or, as Hegel would
340                               Quantum History


have put it, perversion is an act which posits its own presupposition, it is an
effect which retroactively posits its cause.
   This circularity is rendered at its purest in M Butterfly (directed by David
Cronenberg, script by David Henry Hwang from his own play), a movie whose
narrative is utter improbability: without the advertisement, in the credits,
that the story is based on true events, nobody would take it seriously. During
the Great Cultural Revolution, a minor French diplomat in Beijing (Jeremy
Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer named Song Liling who sings
some Puccini arias at a reception for foreigners (John Lone). His courting leads
to a lasting love relationship; Song, who is to him the fatal love object (with
reference to Puccini’s opera, he affectionately calls her “my butterfly”), gets
pregnant and bears him a child. While their affair goes on, she induces him to
spy for China, claiming that this is the only way the Chinese authorities will
tolerate their association. After a professional failure, the diplomat is transferred
to Paris where he is assigned to the minor post of diplomatic courier. Soon
afterwards, his love joins him there and tells him that if he will carry on with
spying for China, the Chinese authorities will allow their child to join them.
When, finally, French security discovers his spying activities and they are both
arrested, it turns out that Song is not a woman at all but a man—in his Eurocentric
ignorance, the hero did not know that in Chinese opera feminine roles are sung
by men.
   It is here that the story stretches the limits of our credulity: how was it that
the hero, in the long years of consumed love, did not see that he was dealing
with a man? The singer incessantly evoked the Chinese sense of shame, s/he
never undressed, they had (unbeknownst to him, anal) sex discreetly, s/he
sitting on his lap . . .—in short, what he mistook for the shyness of the
“Oriental” woman was a deft manipulation destined to conceal the fact that
“she” was not biologically a woman at all. The choice of the music that obsesses
the hero is crucial: the famous aria “Un bel di, vedremo” from Madama Butterfly,
perhaps the most expressive example of Puccini’s gesture that is the very
opposite of bashful self-concealment—the obscenely candid self-exposure of
the (feminine) subject that always borders upon kitsch. The subject pathetically
professes what she is and what she wants, she lays bare her most intimate and
frail dreams—a confession that, of course, reaches its apogee in the desire to
                               Sexual Superpositions                           341


die (in “Un bel di, vedremo”, Madama Butterfly imagines the scene of Pinkerton’s
return: at first, she will not answer his call, “in part for fun and in part not to
die at the first encounter [per non morir al primo incontro]”).
   From what we have just said, it may seem that the hero’s tragic blunder
consists in projecting his fantasy-image onto an inadequate object, i.e., in
mistaking a real person for his fantasy-image of the love object, the “Oriental”
woman of the Madame Butterfly type. However, things are definitely more
complex. The key scene of the film occurs after the trial, when the hero and
Song, now wearing an ordinary man’s suit, find themselves alone in the closed
compartment of a police car on their way to prison. Song takes off his clothes
and offers himself naked to the hero, desperately proclaiming his availability:
“Here I am, your butterfly!” He proposes himself as what he is outside the
hero’s fantasy frame of a mysterious Chinese woman. At this crucial moment,
the hero retreats: he avoids looking at his lover and rejects the offer. It is here
that he compromises his desire and thus contracts an indelible guilt—he
betrays the true love that aims at the real kernel of the object beneath the
fantasmatic envelopes.
   The painful final scene of the film conveys the hero’s full recognition of his
guilt (in clear contrast to Ponelle’s staging of Wagner’s Tristan in which Tristan
is not ready to abandon the fantasy of Isolde: he can only die imagining her
presence). In the prison, he stages a performance for his vulgar and noisy
fellow-prisoners: dressed as Madama Butterfly (the Japanese kimono, heavily
made-up face) and accompanied by excerpts from Puccini’s opera, he retells
his story; at the very climax of “Un bel di, vedremo”, he cuts his throat with a
razor and collapses dead. This act of a man dressed as a woman who performs
a public suicide is of a strictly ethical nature: the hero stages a psychotic
identification with his love object, with his sinthome (synthetic formation of
the nonexistent woman, “Butterfly”), i.e., he “regresses” from the object-choice
to an immediate identification with the object; the only way out of the insoluble
deadlock of this identification is suicide qua the ultimate passage a l’acte. By
way of his suicidal act, the hero makes up for his guilt, for his rejection of the
object when the object was offered to him outside the fantasy-frame.
   In other words, the hero experiences the separation, the gap between the
idealized image of his love object and the reality of the Chinese man who
342                               Quantum History


assumed this image, and is thus confronted with the fact that his love object
was his own fantasmatic construct, a mere semblance. At this point, his
desperate stratagem is to supplement this semblance, to provide for its “flesh,”
by directly offering his own body as its “stuff.” In this way, he becomes his own
object-cause, i.e., he assumes the object-cause of his desire as his own—such a
direct identification, of course, is lethal, impossible to sustain. The identification
with the lost object is here brought to its logical (suicidal) conclusion: if I am
the lost object, then I can fully and authentically “be” only insofar as I lose
(obliterate) myself . . . This is the authentic melancholic ethics, in contrast to
the “postmodern” compromise solution, where the uprooted subject retains
the melancholic fidelity to his lost ethnic roots, while fully participating in the
global capitalist economy.
   The film thus also implicitly echoes Freud’s infamous statement concerning
the status of sexual difference: “Anatomy is destiny.” This statement should be
read as a Hegelian “speculative judgement” in which the predicate “passes over”
into the subject. That is to say, its true meaning is not the obvious one, the
standard target of feminist critique (“the anatomical difference between the
sexes directly founds, is directly responsible for, the different socio-symbolic
roles of men and women”), but rather the opposite one: the “truth” of the anatomy
is “destiny,” i.e., a symbolic formation. In the case of sexual identity, an anatomic
difference is “sublated,” turned into the medium of appearance/expression—
more precisely, into the material support—of a certain symbolic formation.
   Does this mean that the space of sexuality is irredeemably chaotic, resisting
any systematization? No—and here we can bring in Hegel once more. Since
the topic of the diversity of sexual practices is much more openly and widely
discussed today than in Hegel’s time, one cannot avoid the task of introducing
into the messy space of sexuality some conceptual order, of deploying not the
empirical history of sexuality but the immanent dynamic of the concept of
sexuality. The task is thus not just classifying sexual practices but also displaying
how the sequence of different stances forms a properly dialectical process in
which each particular form resolves the antagonism of the previous form and
gives birth to a new antagonism of its own since il n’y a pas de rapport sexuel.
The task is thus nothing less than a Hegelian system of sexuality in the standard
form of successive triads.
                              Sexual Superpositions                           343


   Where to begin then? Human sexuality emerges through a clear cut with
animal copulation which aims at procreation, so at its zero-level it implies that
every bodily contact with another is excluded: sexual pleasure should be
explicitly posited as an end-in-itself, serving no biological function. The only
form of sexuality that fully meets this condition is masturbation—but not
masturbation alone (which is also practiced by some animals). Since a human
being is a spiritual being, a being whose mind is plagued by products of its
creative (and destructive) imagination, the zero-level of human sexuality is
masturbation accompanied and sustained even by imagination, by sexual
fantasies—to put it in a somewhat vulgar way, while I do it to myself, I dream
about doing it with others. Kant was quite right to claim that masturbation
with imagination is the lowest degeneration of sexuality, the most radical
abandonment of its natural goal:

   Lust [the “impetus” to sexual “pleasure”] is called unnatural if one is aroused
   to it not by a real object but by his imagining it, so that he himself creates
   one, contrary to [natural] purpose; for in this way imagination brings forth
   a desire contrary to nature’s end.5

But those who today celebrate masturbation as the most basic and democratic
form of sexual activity are, in their own way, also right: “masturbathon” (a large
group of people masturbating openly at the same place) builds a collective
out of individuals who are ready to share the solipsism of their own stupid
enjoyment, and is as such the form of sexuality which fits these cyberspace
coordinates perfectly. Here is how Dr. Carol Queen justifies masturbation:

   Masturbation is our first sexual activity, a natural source of pleasure that’s
   available to us throughout our lives, and a unique form of creative self-
   expression. Each time you masturbate, you’re celebrating your sexuality and
   your innate capacity for pleasure, so give yourself a hand! . . . Masturbation
   can be a radical act, and the culture that suppresses masturbation may
   suppress many other personal freedoms as well.6

This is why Lacan suggests that, whereas the basic form of sexuality for animals
is copulation, the basic form of sexuality for humans is masturbation. The
structure of masturbation sustained by (and simultaneously split from)
344                              Quantum History


fantasizing is a universal feature of human sexuality, it is operative in all of its
forms. “The act of sex for humans is so much caught up in our fantasies (our
idealized images of both ourselves and our sexual partners) that it is ultimately
narcissistic.”7 This is what Lacan had in mind with his il n’y a pas de rapport
sexuel: not only is masturbation sex with an imagined partner (one does it to
oneself, arousing oneself with imagined activity with partners); in a strictly
symmetrical way, “real sex” has the structure of masturbation with a real
partner: I effectively use the flesh-and-blood partner as a masturbatory prop
for enacting my fantasies. In other words, what makes this notion of sexuality
so traumatic for those attached to “real communication with real people” is not
that the link to a flesh-and-blood person is cut, but that we are forced to realize
how sex always-already was “virtual,” with flesh-and-blood persons used as
masturbatory props for dwelling in our fantasies.
   The next step is the return to the bodily form of animal copulation—coitus
a tergo—but with a new function: since the two partners don’t face each other,
each of them is free to pursue its own fantasies during the sexual act, and
these fantasies are not linked to the fantasies that sustain the other partner.
When the division between fantasy and bodily reality becomes too strong,
the only way out is the desperate attempt to unite the bodily and the spiritual
dimension—we are, of course, talking about the so-called missionary position
(advocated by the Catholic Church precisely for this reason: the face-to-face
conjunction is meant to establish a spiritual proximity). But it is obvious that
the gap returns in an even stronger form because the face-to-face encounter
renders palpable the discord of the underlying fantasies. The worst solution
occurs when the lovers decide to accompany their bodily activity with talking,
trying to stimulate each other with tender or dirty details—the gap is exposed
in all its ridicule.
                                    *
Now the real mess begins with an almost endless series of desperate attempts
to close the gap between fantasy and the miserable reality of sex by way of
improvising different bodily positions, under the implicit motto “if the words
fail let’s try to achieve it with our bodies.” The obvious first variation is to
change the partner: a man instead of a woman or vice versa. (One could, of
course, replace the human partner with an animal. From my youth in the 1960s
                               Sexual Superpositions                            345


and 1970s, I remember short illustrated handbooks teaching men how to
penetrate a goat or a cow and women how to arouse a dog or a horse to
penetrate them.)
   The next step is to experiment with all possible variations of group sex: two
couples doing it together, a group of men in a circle penetrating each other, etc.
One popular variation involves one woman with three man penetrating her
simultaneously: vaginally, anally and orally; however, the paradigmatic case is
what one might call “the Swiss army wife” position, a woman who is able to use
all her holes and limbs to simultaneously satisfy a group of men.
   This important dialectical-materialist concept of “Swiss army wife” points
towards the next variation: all possible combinations between the three main
holes (vaginal, anal, mouth) and the three main penetrating instruments
(penis, tongue, hand). This brings us to the next step: the gradual disappearance
of the distinction between foreplay and the sexual act proper (penetration):
mostly what was traditionally considered from a heteronormative point of
view a form of foreplay (kissing, fingering, and other forms of caressing)
becomes an end-in-itself, so that the big penetrative act is simply no longer
needed. There are, of course, many other attempts to reconcile the contradictions
we have identified, including extreme forms of masochism like coprophagia
(compulsive eating of feces) or brutal masochism (like self-castration), but all
this obviously ends up in a deadlock—so how can we get out of it?
   We must conceptualize the self-sublation of sexuality in a truly dialectical-
materialist way, as an act of immanent self-overcoming, not just external
negation from some “higher” spiritual position. Perhaps we should take
inspiration from the corporate world and overcome sexual activity by
outsourcing it. Recently, the so-called “Stamina Training Unit” appeared on the
market, a masturbatory device that resembles a battery-powered light (so we’re
not embarrassed when carrying it around). You put the erect penis into the
opening at the top, push the button, and the object vibrates till satisfaction . . .
So let’s say I am flirting with a lady and we decide to do it: we meet at her place
or mine, she brings her vibrator and I my Stamina Training Unit, we plug both
toys into a source of electricity, then we push the vibrator into the Stamina
Training Unit, turn them both on and leave all the fun to this ideal couple.
Accompanied by the pleasant background buzzing, we—the two real human
346                               Quantum History


partners—then sit down at a nearby table, drink tea and eat cake, both of us
calmly enjoying the fact that, without great effort, we have fulfilled our duty to
enjoy through the machines. In this way, we are free to engage in a nice talk,
with no pressure that this talk must lead to sexual activity: we can just enjoy it
and become asexual friends.
   The Scriptures defined this passage from sexual coupling to asexual
friendship in terms of eros (sexual love) and philia (asexual affection/
friendship), and added two further types of love to this taxonomy: storge
(parental familial love) and agape (the unconditional love that unites
individuals who dedicate their lives to a Cause). At the level of agape, feelings
(sexual or not) no longer matter, what remains is just Holy Spirit, an egalitarian
community of comrades dedicated to a Cause.8 As a comrade, I can involve
myself sexually with another comrade, I can become his/her friend, but this
doesn’t really matter: if the situation of a struggle demands it, I should be ready
to betray him/her because only the Cause matters. And if my comrade is a true
comrade s/he will fully understand me and even despise me if I allow any
weakness for him/her to overcome my fidelity to the shared cause and am not
ready to betray him/her. There is nothing spontaneous about such an egalitarian
community of comrades—it requires hard work and full commitment, so it is
the very opposite of “egalitarian” morality as it was nicely summed up by Rúben
Gallo: “human beings, regardless of gender, race, social class, or nationality, are
invariably selfish, cruel, and corrupt.”9
   At the other end of the spectrum, there is the deliberate ignoring of the link
between sexuality and (sexual) love as another form of the self-sublation of
sexuality. As Lacan put it, love supplements the impossibility/failure of sexual
relationship: it is not an imaginary illusion destined to obfuscate the ultimate
failure of any sexual relationship, but, on the contrary, the only link to another
human being which is open to another human being in its radical alterity,
accepting it without any idealization. It is only love that makes a sexual act
non-masturbatory. But here another deadlock emerges, that of the excess of
love itself perspicuously encapsulated by Neil Gaiman:

   You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that
   nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other
                                 Sexual Superpositions                                347


   stupid person, wanders into your stupid life . . . You give them a piece of you.
   They didn’t ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or
   smile at you, and then your life isn’t your own anymore. Love takes hostages.
   It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness . . . It
   hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It’s a soul-hurt, a
   real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.10

This is why one should fearlessly endorse the result of the study from the University
of Valencia: “Just five minutes alone with an attractive female raise the levels of
cortisol, the body’s stress hormone.”11 However, as Hegel hinted in some passages,
there is a cure for the horror of intense love—it’s called marriage. A (not too)
vulgar joke provides an insight into a truly happy marriage. Late in the evening, a
wife and a husband lie in bed; the wife is trying to fall asleep, while the husband is
reading a book. Every couple of minutes, he reaches with his hand over to the wife
and gently rubs her vaginal lips with his finger. After this goes on for half an hour,
the wife explodes: “I am trying to fall asleep! If you want to have sex, do it fast, don’t
play with me like that!” The husband replies: “Sorry, it is not about sex. I am just
reading a book and every couple of minutes I need to wet my finger to turn a new
page . . .” This brings us to Pascal: the true Pascalean formula of marriage is not
“You don’t love your partner? Then marry him or her, go through the ritual of
shared life, and love will emerge by itself!”; it is, on the contrary: “Are you too much
in love with somebody? Then get married, ritualize your love relationship, in order
to cure yourself of the excessive passionate attachment, to replace it with the
boring daily custom . . .” Marriage is thus a means of re-normalization which cures
us of the violence of falling in love. (And, incidentally, are many “radical” Leftist
intellectuals not doing something similar to the unfortunate husband? Afraid to
approach the real of actual political struggle they just touch it fleetingly to wet
their finger and go on reading and writing academic books which criticize actual
fighters.) Today, unfortunately, marriage is less and less needed because in our
time of permissiveness a passionate sexual love for a single person is quite often
dismissed as too fixating—you can play (consensual) sexual games with many
people, just don’t get too stuck on one of them.
   To conclude, let’s raise the final question: what can psychoanalysis do when
confronted with a trans patient caught in the mess of multiple identities and
348                               Quantum History


modes of enjoyment, unable to decide what he/she/it “really is”? In an interview
published a couple of years ago (“The Trans Solution,”12 in which he also
passingly dismisses Lacan’s use of mathematical formulas as “just parodies”),
Jacques-Alain Miller clarifies his (and, by extension, what he considers the
Lacanian) stance towards the transactivists who are

   full-fledged political activists, and with that, very sensitive. They promote a
   “gender identity” that is intimate, innate and definitive. The subject would
   be the only one to know in its heart of hearts who it is, as it were, gendered.
   In short,“I am what I say I am,” all trans people are transparent to themselves.
   So they demand an immediate transition, and at all ages, as soon as a subject,
   even a child, says it is uncomfortable with its body. This is the famous
   “gender self-determination” on which, in Western countries, the public
   authorities are gradually aligning themselves. Victoire! Will it be sustainable?
   The bets are open. Still, it is the exact opposite of psychoanalysis whose act
   is based on interpretation, that is to say on the fact that the subject does not
   really know what it is saying.

While I agree with Miller’s basic line of argumentation, I find many of its
details incorrect and deceiving. For many trans subjects, their gender identity
is NOT “innate and definitive” but an everlasting process of performative
transformation since all trans people are NOT “transparent to themselves.” For
them, psychoanalysis is not problematic because it presumes that the subject
“does not really know what it is saying” but because the analytic process of
interpretation is not neutral: it is sustained by an implicit normative dimension.
Someone gave me a badge with an (apocryphal, of course) quote from Stalin:
“I trust no one, not even myself.” The real Stalin was precisely not able to
include himself into the list of people he didn’t trust. And the same should be
said about trans subjects: not only are they not what they appear to others
(“people around me take me for a man, but I am a woman”), they are also not
what they themselves think they are.
   I would only add to this that today this dimension is not predominantly
patriarchal/heterosexual but tends precisely towards a notion of infinite
plasticity of sexual identities. The implication of this fact is that (today, at least)
we cannot simply say that the analytic process really reaches its conclusion
                              Sexual Superpositions                           349


when “the subject has completed its speaking journey (son parcours de parole),
that it has clarified its desire or its conviction”? And can we really simply say
that after this point “the choice is theirs”? Does a subject ever reach this point
at which its libidinal economy becomes transparent to him so that he can
from some neutral position make a choice? When Miller concludes that “we
see suffering subjects who finally find relief in the transition, and their
particular definition as sexual beings,” how can we be sure that this “relief ” is
not a fake, i.e., that the newly-found “particular definition” of a subject as a
sexual being is not just a new symptom-formation destined to obfuscate the
trauma of sexuality? Does this not bring us to late Lacan’s modest determination
of the psychoanalytic treatment whose goal is just to enable the patient to
construct a symptom which would enable him/her/it to lead a relatively
tolerable life?
   At a more formal level, the question of how to measure the truth of sexual
intercourse gets even more complex. Let’s turn to two different versions of the
same joke which will hopefully enable us to clarify a key conceptual difference.
I knew for years a classic vulgar joke about an American who seduces a
Japanese lady during a business trip to Tokyo; they end up in bed, and during
their passionate love-making, the woman is repeatedly shouting two words in
Japanese that the American doesn’t understand but presumes they express her
full pleasure. The next day he goes to play golf with his business partners and
after he hits the ball, his partners shout the same words as the lady the previous
night. Perplexed, he asks them what these words mean, and they explain it to
him: “Wrong hole!” Recently I was told another version: after he hits the ball on
the golf course, all his partners applaud passionately because he put the ball
into a hole with the first strike. He wants to join their celebration and repeats
loudly the two words he heard during the love-making, presuming they express
pleasure and satisfaction, but his partners’ faces reveal surprise and
consternation. He asks one of them what was wrong, and gets the answer: “Are
you making fun of us? Why are you shouting ‘Wrong hole!’ when you put
the ball into the right hole?” The vulgarity of the joke notwithstanding, the
difference between its two versions is worth a closer look. In both cases, the
first act is a double failure: not only with regard to what went on (he penetrates
the “wrong hole”) but also a misunderstanding (the American misreads the
350                               Quantum History


woman’s cries as praise); the misunderstanding is clarified in the second act,
but in the opposite direction. In the first version, the American’s golf partners
repeat the same words because, as with the Japanese lady, he missed the proper
hole; in the second version, he himself repeats the two words he doesn’t
understand because this time he did hit the right hole, and he thinks he is
joining the celebration of his success. You do the wrong thing (miss the proper
hole), and the words are used (by the partners) in its right meaning; you do the
right thing (ball in the hole), and you use the words in the wrong meaning. As
in hardcore movies, the penetrated woman is presumed to enjoy it ecstatically
even if the male partner put it into a wrong hole—and in some sense, since
“there is no sexual relationship,” the sexual encounter is always a failed one, the
hole is always a wrong one, the man misreads his act as a triumph. If the man
repeats the act of filling a hole in a non-sexual context (like playing golf), there
are two options. If you miss the hole again, the big Other (embodied here in
your partners on the golf course) will repeat the women’s words, and you will
finally get the message that your “triumph” was a painful fiasco. If you hit the
right hole, you appear an even greater idiot because, unknowingly, you declare
it a failure, and the big Other is offended . . .
   The key feature here is that this joke works only when the first act is sexual
and the second is asexual (playing golf). Let’s try to reimagine it in the opposite
order: I play golf with my partners, I miss the hole and I hear them shouting
two words that I don’t understand; the same evening, I make love with a
Japanese woman and hear her shouting the same two words which I don’t
understand, so I ask her what they mean . . . but wouldn’t it be more logical to
ask already my partners on the golf course than to raise the question in the
middle of (what was for me at least) a passionate intercourse? So the joke
works because (due to a vulgar association of the two holes to be filled in) in
sex the hole is always in some way missed and the communication
misunderstood, while in asexual life (overdetermined by sexual innuendos) I
may hit the right hole or not, but the misunderstanding persists. We can
speculate that this is the general structure of our lives as sexed beings: sex
remains a mess, and the only way to introduce a little bit of order into this mess
is through engaging in non-sexual activities which, although they remain
overshadowed by sex, allow us to escape the vortex of sex. My reading is thus
                               Sexual Superpositions                           351


that the second version of the joke is the right one: I hit the right hole, but my
mistake (shouting “Wrong hole!”) is also right at the level of sexuality because
there is no sexual relationship—I am right without knowing it, of course, and
the big Other which corrects my misunderstanding is wrong.
   Aaron Schuster notes how Josephine the singing mouse from Kafka’s last
story “simulates her self-loss in order to truly lose herself without psychotically
falling apart, without this loss turning to anxiety, panic, or revulsion. She thus
creates a true illusion.”13 Every word counts here—“true illusion” is not simply
an illusion (product of our mind) which happens to represent correctly
external reality; the content of the illusion is true, but the only way for me to
accept it, not to be crushed by it into a psychotic breakdown, is to treat is as a
mere illusion. The same holds also for a fundamentalist political passion: you
have to maintain a minimal distance towards it if you are to avoid psychotic
breakdown. And the same holds for love: when we are passionately in love, we
struggle to retain a minimal distance towards it, we tell ourselves “I am just
playing at being fully in love” because we are afraid that fully assuming the
sexual passion will drive us crazy.

              Make the kitchen
                maid king


As is well known, Hegel advocated constitutional monarchy as the only
appropriate form of political order that fits modern society. His numerous
critics see this weird advocacy either as a clear sign of Hegel’s immanent
philosophical limitation or as a sign of his political conformism, with some
more benevolently disposed critics interpreting it as a cunning trick to delude
state censorship (first among these sarcastic critics is none other than Marx).1
Klaus Vieweg’s critique of Hegel’s deduction of monarchy is by far the most
thoughtful in this vein: what he tries to prove is that Hegel’s deduction is
wrong in Hegel’s own terms. Hegel justifies the necessary role of the monarch
with reference to the syllogism, to the syllogistic structure of the state power,
but Vieweg claims that the very form of syllogism to which he refers (disjunctive
syllogism) would impose a democratic solution with people as the ultimate
source of legitimate power.2 So can Hegel be fully defended today? Let’s begin
with Mark Tunick’s concise summary of Hegel’s position:

  Hegel is not a democrat. He is a monarchist. But he wants monarchy because
  he does not want strong government. He wants to deemphasize power. He
  develops an idealist conception of sovereignty that allows for a monarch
  less powerful than a president . . .3

That is to say, less powerful than a democratically elected president. How would
this work in practice?


                                                                             353
354                              Quantum History


   Hegel supposes that the monarch’s counsel, whose members are chosen by
   objective criteria, can resolve an issue at least to the point where only an
   arbitrary will can choose among the options. The counsel rules out all the
   bad alternatives (which democracy doesn’t do), until the remaining options
   are equally meritorious. Even if the monarch decided every political issue,
   the issues he’d be deciding would be different than the issues as they first
   appear, and which a democratic vote would have resolved. The monarch
   makes a “groundless” decision that still has grounds.

Tunick uses the example of prison overcrowding: some of the potential
solutions to the problem (such as letting convicted criminals go free or killing
all the prisoners) will be eliminated by the counsel. “The remaining alternatives
are grounded (i.e., in the principle that we must not kill, or that we must punish
wrongdoers), but suppose it’s arbitrary which of them we choose. The monarch
decides this.”4
   It should be clear from this example what Hegel fears (as well as why his fear
is even more urgent today): the direct rule of experts which justify their
decisions with (pseudo-scientific) reasons incomprehensible to the majority of
ordinary citizens. Just recall how today economic decisions are legitimized by
experts as simple neutral scientific insight, and in this way the political bias of
these decisions disappears from view, dismissed as “ideological” . . . Hegel is
aware that a Master who is elevated above the system of knowledge (in
Lacanian terms, of the “discourse of university”) is needed, so he wants to keep
the power that decides outside expert knowledge. However, he is at the same
time aware that a return to the premodern master who reigns directly is
unacceptable in modern times; his solution is therefore a monarch whose
function is ultimately just to dot the s’s and cross the t’s, to sign his name on
decisions prepared and proposed by qualified experts.
   Vieweg is right in claiming that the key for the proper understanding of
Hegel’s notion of monarch is provided by his notion of disjunctive syllogism
(as a further development of the syllogism of necessity); but he accuses Hegel
of misreading the political implications of this syllogism. Its structure is that
of PUI: the universal dimension (people represented in legislative assembly)
mediates between the particular dimension (executive power) and the
                            Make the Kitchen Maid King                         355


individual (monarch as the decision-maker). In short, in contrast to the
premodern monarchy where the king directly rules over its subjects, in a
modern state the people in their universal dimension regulate and control
both extreme, executive and deciding power:

   The application of the disjunctive syllogism to the structure of the state’s
   internal constitution leads to a most surprising result in contrast to what
   the Outlines (of the Philosophy of Right) claims: it affects the theoretical
   legitimization of a republican, democratic constitution and reveals the
   fundamental importance of the legislative assembly as an expression of a
   representative-democratic structure.5

But does Hegel really violate the logic of disjunctive syllogism? It is Vieweg
himself who ignores what its name indicates, the dimension of disjunction
located by Hegel into the mediating universality itself—here is a passage from
Hegel’s small logic (Encyclopaedia, par 191) which already points towards the
role of the monarch:

   the mediating Universal is explicitly put as a totality of its particular
   members, and as a single particular, or exclusive individuality—which
   happens in the Disjunctive syllogism. It is one and the same universal which
   is in these terms of the Disjunctive syllogism; they are only different forms
   for expressing it.6

Disjunction thus divides Universality itself into the totality of its particular
members and the exclusive individuality which directly gives body to the
universality—as we say in everyday jargon, the monarch does not represent
the people, the monarch IS the people, only through the monarch is the
universality of the people actualized. In his precise essay “The Jurisdiction of
the Hegelian Monarch,”7 Jean-Luc Nancy emphasizes this performative
dimension of the monarch (to use today’s parlance) which comes close to what
Lacan called the pure signifier (the Master-Signifier, a signifier which falls into
the signified and is as such a signifier without signified). This is how one
should read the tautology “Socialism is socialism”—recall the old Polish anti-
Communist joke: “Socialism is the synthesis of the highest achievements of all
previous historical epochs: from tribal society, it took barbarism, from
356                               Quantum History


antiquity, it took slavery, from feudalism, it took relations of domination, from
capitalism, it took exploitation, and from socialism, it took the name.” Does
the same not hold for the anti-Semitic image of the Jew? From the rich bankers,
it took financial speculation, from capitalists, it took exploitation, from
lawyers, it took legal trickery, from corrupt journalists, it took media
manipulation, from the poor, it took indifference towards washing one’s body,
from sexual libertines it took promiscuity, and from the Jews it took the name
. . . And this is also why a king is a king: he just adds his/her name. But, again,
why is a monarch needed? Why is it that representative democracy (or, even
better, some form of direct self-organization of the people) cannot do the job?
   To fully grasp this, one should take note of the gap that separates two
syllogistic triads: that of the entire society (individual family life, market and
production in civil society, state) and that of the state as institution (legislative
power, executive power, decider-monarch: UPI). When Vieweg elevates the
political form of universality (“legislative assembly as an expression of a
representative-democratic structure”) into the central mediating role, he
ignores another disjunction: however it is formed (even in the most open
democratic elections with universal right to vote), legislative power is always
by definition at a gap from “actual people.”
   In past decades, a whole series of events made this gap palpable.
Remember the protests of yellow vests (gilets jaunes) in France that went on
for over twenty weekends from late 2018 to early 2019. They began as a
grassroots movement that grew out of widespread discontent with a new
eco-tax on petrol and diesel, seen as hitting those living and working outside
metropolitan areas where there is no public transport. The movement has
grown to include a panoply of demands, including “frexit” (the exit of France
from EU), lower taxes, higher pensions, and an improvement in ordinary
French people’s spending power. They offer an exemplary case of the Leftist
populism, of the explosion of people’s wrath in all its inconsistency: lower
taxes and more money for education and health care, cheaper petrol and
ecological struggle . . . Although the new petrol tax was obviously an excuse or,
rather, pretext, not what the protests are “really about,” it is significant to note
that what triggered the protests was a measure intended to act against global
warming. No wonder Trump enthusiastically supported yellow vests (even
                           Make the Kitchen Maid King                         357


hallucinating shouts “We want Trump!” from some of the protesters), noting
that one of the demands was for France to step out of the Paris agreement. The
thing to note here is that when representative of yellow vests met with
government representatives, the talks were a total failure—they simply didn’t
speak the same language.
   Or recall the UK elections of 2005: in spite of the growing unpopularity of
Tony Blair (he was regularly voted the most unpopular person in the UK), he
won the general elections—there was no way for this discontent with Blair to
find a politically effective expression. Something is obviously very wrong
here—it is not that people “do not know what they want,” but, rather, that
cynical resignation prevents them from acting upon it, so that the result is the
weird gap between what people think and how they act (vote); such a frustration
can foment dangerous extra-parliamentary explosions, especially in the form
of rage in today’s populism.
   Years ago, the Spanish Podemos undoubtedly stood for the populist protests
against the state mechanisms at its best: against the arrogant Politically Correct
intellectual elites which despise the “narrowness” of the ordinary people who
are considered “stupid” for “voting against their interests,” its organizing
principle was to listen to and organize those “from below” against those “from
above,” beyond all traditional Left and Right models. The idea was that the
starting point of emancipatory politics should be the concrete experience of
the suffering and injustices of ordinary people in their local life-world (home
quarter, workplace, etc.), not abstract visions of a future Communist or
whatsoever society. (Although the new digital media seem to open up the
space for new communities, the difference between these new communities
and the old life-world communities is crucial: these old communities are not
chosen, I am born into them, they form the very space of my socialization,
while the new (digital) communities include me into a specific domain defined
by my interests and thus depending on my choice.)
   Far from making the old “spontaneous” communities deficient, the fact that
they do not rely on my free choice makes them superior with regard to the new
digital communities since they compel me to find my way into a pre-existing
not-chosen life-world in which I encounter (and have to learn to deal with)
real differences, while the new digital communities depending on my choice
358                              Quantum History


sustain the ideological myth of the individual who somehow pre-exists a
communal life and is free to choose it.) While this approach undoubtedly
contains a (very big) grain of truth, its problem is that, to put it bluntly, not
only, as Laclau liked to emphasize, society doesn’t exist, but “people” also doesn’t
exist . . . However, problems arose when Podemos decided to change into a
political party and entered a government: its politics there was indistinguishable
from a moderate social-democratic party.
                                    *
Can this gap be filled by deliberative democracy, composed of popular
assemblies composed of civil experts and individuals chosen by lot to debate a
certain topic? Deliberative democracy can help, but it must be sustained by a
clear structure of decision—the key point is that the deliberative assemblies
don’t decide. This is why, today even, something like monarchy is needed. As the
top-decider, he is not qualified by any characteristics, he stands for the people
as such, in its universality, which are excluded not only from the state
institutions but also encompass all inner divisions and factional struggles. This
disjunctive unity is best rendered by the fact that media report on the personal
habits and preferences of the monarch and his family (music, books, gardening,
sports . . .), things that are totally uninteresting in an ordinary person—who
cares what food my neighbour likes! The king is a common man elevated into
the top-decider—more radically, we can even say that he is a member of
the rabble, of those with no determinate place in social hierarchy. We must
take into account here the difference between sublation (Aufhebung) and
sublimation: when an object is sublated into a higher form, it is not sublimated.
Sublimation occurs when what resists sublation, its indivisible/non-sublatable
remainder, is elevated from the status of trash to a sacred object, to a stand-I
for the void, for what is excluded from the symbolic order. In Hegel’s theory of
monarchy, the monarch is a non-sublated rest of the social edifice, his position
is not mediated through its social achievements, it is just determined by the
biological contingency of his birth, he is with regard to his properties like any
other ordinary citizen, and he is as such elevated to a sacred status, to the
sublime embodiment of society as a whole. One thing is sure: the way to
reinvent something-like-a-king today should definitely include a lottery
aspect, it should be left to chance. What is expected from a monarch is just
                             Make the Kitchen Maid King                           359


some common sense since, to quote Bill Murray: “Common sense is like
deodorant. The people who need it most never use it.” Was Lenin himself not
on the path towards this solution when, in his State and Revolution, he proposed
the famous slogan: “Every Kitchen Maid Should Learn to Rule the State”? It is
worth taking a closer look at the precise context of Lenin’s justification of this
slogan which, at a first sight, may appear extremely utopian, especially since he
emphasizes that the slogan designates something that “can and must be made
at once, overnight,” not in some later Communist future: “the mechanism of
social management is here already to hand”8 in modern capitalism—the
mechanism of the automatic functioning of a large production process where
the bosses (representing the owner) just give formal orders. This mechanism
runs so smoothly that, without disturbing it, the role of the boss is reduced to
simple decisions and can be played by an ordinary person. So all the Socialist
revolution has to do is to replace the capitalist or state-appointed boss with an
(randomly selected) ordinary person.
                                            *
But it didn’t work in this way, and it is interesting to see how it didn’t work: there
is one title which condenses what went wrong, that of the “General Secretary”
of the Party. After the Bolshevik victory in the Civil War, the Office of General
Secretary was created by Lenin in 1922 with the intention that it serve a purely
administrative and disciplinary purpose. Prior to Stalin’s accession, the position
was not viewed as an important role in Lenin’s government: previous occupants
had been responsible for technical rather than political decisions. Its primary
task was to determine the composition of party membership and to assign
positions within the party. The General Secretary also oversaw the recording
of party events, and was entrusted with keeping party leaders and members
informed about party activities.9 So how did we arrive from this non-political
“technical” role to the position of the absolute Master not only of the Party
but also of the state and its entire population? The problem was not that the
General Secretary was a new form of monarchic dictatorship, but the exact
opposite: the General Secretary, imagined as a modest non-political post,
filled in the gap opened up by the absence of a monarchic (purely symbolic)
power.

360                               Quantum History


In some countries (the US, Israel) in which the executive branch is perceived
as getting too strong, the role of the monarch can be partially taken over by
the Supreme (or Constitutional) Court—is this not why, in the months before
the Hamas attack of October 7, 2024, the political struggle that triggered mass
demonstrations in Israel was the opposition’s attempts to prevent the
government from abolishing the autonomy of the Supreme Court? Although
the function of the Supreme Court is just to protect the rule of law, it often has
to decide in ambiguous or open situations. Another social institution which
can (rarely, but nonetheless) play this role is

   the army, as none other than Fredric Jameson argued in his magisterial An
   American Utopia: Dual Power and the Universal Army10—his point is that
   the army could play this role precisely because it is organized in a
   non-democratic way (top generals are not elected, etc.).

That’s why Hegel fanatically opposes all reasoning about the justification of a
king’s authority: this authority is not a topic of debate, it is unconditional and, as
such, empty. The best argument against the monarch’s actual power is the
tautology: “The king is a king.” In his brief outline of social ontology, Kafka
distinguishes three levels that he designates with A, B, and C.11 To put it in a very
simplified way, A is the One, the core of our being out of our direct reach, or
(politically) the summit of power. As such, A is always minimally transcendent,
its signs cannot be read in an unambiguous way, so they have to be interpreted,
transformed into fixed regulations, by some form of B: ideological institutions,
interpreters of the obscure Sacred Word which bombard individual subjects (C)
with messages that remain ambiguous since their A remains blurred. Is there a
solution to this predicament? The worst option by far is B without A, i.e., a reign
of experts with no higher authority—this is the most concise definition of
totalitarianism where inconsistent institutions reign. An A is thus needed, but
how to avoid a traditional authority like monarchy? I am more and more
inclined to claim that a monarchy with a stupid monarch who is selected by a
lot and is just like one of us, with no expert knowledge (like Lenin’s kitchen
maid) is the only realistic solution even if it appears the most utopian.
   To venture further still, the structure should be triple: not just democracy
plus a stupid monarch elected by a lot, but a collective body standing for social
                           Make the Kitchen Maid King                        361


wisdom, not just experts (disgusting as this word is). Take ecology: the
necessary tough measures needed to cope with ecological threats cannot be
left to democratic vote. Today, in an age when the fateful limitation of the
Western model of multiparty liberal democracy is becoming more and more
obvious, the need to supplement liberal democracy with another mechanism
of power is also growing. Attempts in this direction are already taking place,
although they largely pass unnoticed. Recall Switzerland, a definitely successful
and stable country. Very few people know who are the ministers there or which
parties have majority—government is considered a kind of neutral mechanism
that one can safely ignore. Plus in Switzerland they often have referendums,
but with a nice totalitarian touch: when a citizen goes to vote, he gets two
pieces of paper—his ballot, and a leaflet where the state gives him/her the
advice on how to vote. (It is through a referendum held in February 1971 that
women got the right to vote, and women’s suffrage didn’t affect in any serious
way the relationship between the political parties.) A couple of decades ago, a
Communist served as the mayor of Geneva, a city which embodies modern
capitalism, and life just went on, with no disturbances (the same thing in 2024
is going on in Graz, Austria). The secret is that, elevated above the state
administration, there is a kind of state council composed of less than 10
(financially, economically . . .) important members who, although they mostly
stay in the shadows, effectively control and regulate social processes.
   With all the inevitable critiques of Iran, one must admit that, when Khomeiny
took power, he took great pains to formalize a quite similar structure: a
democracy, but with an external body controlling it, deciding, vetoing, etc. This
body is the Guardian Council composed of the top representatives of the
Muslim Clergy and led by the Supreme Leader (first Khomeiny himself, now
Khamenei). Iran has a democratically-elected parliament, prime minister and
president, but all candidates have to be confirmed (and are often vetoed) by the
Supreme Leader to safeguard the Islamic purity of Iran. Iranian constitution
has thus been called a “hybrid” of “theocratic and democratic elements,” While
Articles 1 and 2 vest sovereignty in God, Article 6 “mandates popular elections
for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.”12
   But what about China today (and Vietnam and . . .)? Do we not have there
the Communist Party as the non-elected guardian which controls and directs
362                              Quantum History


the state apparatus inclusive of all elected bodies? There are obvious problems
with this model: elected bodies are a rubber stamp for the decisions of the
party (which, interesting to note, is excluded from the legal system: it doesn’t
exist from the standpoint of the law, it is nowhere registered as a legal entity)
plus what is obviously missing is a stupid monarch elected by lot. China is thus
further away from this goal than Iran, where there is a minimum of public
political struggles (between “moderates” and “hardliners”).
   But the main problem here is, of course: how will this controlling body be
nominated? Who will do it? Of course it should NOT be democratically
elected, and it is also not “apolitical”—in some sense, it is the most political
body of them all, the outcome of an informal class struggle. Ideally, its basic
orientation should be that of a moderately-conservative Communism (aware
of the urgency of radical changes, but cautious in their realization—my own
stance, curiously enough!). In contrast to the democratic state administration,
it clearly stands for a dictatorial element.
   I am far from suggesting that we need the same (Iranian) model in Europe
(after all, Iran is an Islamic republic based on a sacred book); however, we in
Europe (and all around the world) are facing the same problem: how to
combine a secular democracy with a non-elected advisory body plus a
non-sacred quilting point, a top agent or agency of formal decision which
performs a political collapse, deciding among democratic superpositions.
      Conclusion: The hunger
         to be something


Hegelian dialectics, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and quantum mechanics may
seem like an oddly-assorted trio, a motley crew. But what they have in common
(apart from my interest in all three) is that they all operate in the mode of
paraconsistent logic, which challenges the predominant model of logic.
According to that traditional logic, from contradictory premises, anything
follows. A logical consequence relation is explosive if according to it any
arbitrary conclusion is entailed by any arbitrary contradiction. Inconsistency,
according to received wisdom, cannot be coherently reasoned about.
Paraconsistent logic challenges this standard view: a logical consequence
relation is said to be paraconsistent if it is not explosive. Thus, if a consequence
relation is paraconsistent, then even in circumstances where the available
information is inconsistent, the consequence relation does not explode into
triviality. Thus, paraconsistent logic accommodates inconsistency in a
controlled way that treats inconsistent information as potentially informative.1
This certainly holds for Hegel in whose thought inconsistency obeys an iron
logic; for Lacan, where inconsistency indicates an intervention of the
unconscious dimension; and for quantum mechanics in which inconsistency
is what defines superpositions (a particle is simultaneously here and there
and . . .)?
   We experience this dimension of paraconsistency at its purest when we
stumble upon the reversal of mediation into a new shape of immediacy. Today,



                                                                                363
364                               Quantum History


Marxists as a rule reject any form of immediacy as a fetish that obfuscates
social mediation. However, in his masterpiece on Adorno,2 Jameson has
shown how dialectical analysis includes its own point of suspension: in the
midst of a complex analysis of mediations, Adorno suddenly makes a vulgar
gesture of “reductionism,” interrupting the flow of dialectical finesse with a
simple point like “ultimately it is about class struggle.” This is how class struggle
functions within a social totality: it is not its “deeper ground” or its profound
structuring principle that mediates all its moments, but something much more
superficial—the point of failure of endless complex analysis. It is a gesture of
jumping ahead to a conclusion, when, in an act of despair, we raise our hands
and say: “But after all, this is all about class struggle!” What we must bear in
mind here is that this failure of analysis is immanent to reality itself; it is how
society totalizes itself through its constitutive antagonism. In other words,
class struggle is a quick and easy pseudo-totalization when proper totalization
fails; it is a desperate attempt to use antagonism itself as the principle of
totalization.
   Recall that during Joe Biden’s inauguration, there was a lone figure who
stole the show by just sitting there, sticking out as an element of discord
disturbing the spectacle: Bernie Sanders. The effect was not that of a person left
out at a party but rather of a person who has no interest in joining. Every
philosopher knows how impressed Hegel was when he saw Napoleon riding
through Jena—it was for him like seeing the world spirit (the predominant
historical tendency) riding a horse . . . The fact that Bernie stole the show and
that the image of him just sitting there instantly became an icon means that the
true world spirit of our time was there, in his lone figure embodying scepticism
about the fake normalization staged in the ceremony—there is still hope for
our cause, people are aware that a more radical change is needed. Lines of
separation thus seemed clearly drawn: liberal establishment embodied in
Biden versus democratic socialists whose most popular representative is
Bernie Sanders.
                                   Conclusion                                 365




But my point here is not a political one, it concerns the inherent necessity for
a general spiritual tendency to “collapse” in a particular person. This is why one
cannot reduce this “collapse” to a form of fetishism in which a complex web of
mediations appears as an immediate presence: only through such a “collapse”
does this complex web (in our case, all the tendencies and hopes that Bernie
personifies) acquire a form of actuality, a positive force that sustains political
engagement. If we take away this collapse we don’t get the general spirit of a
world in its clean form, without any contingent empirical elements—what we
get is a mess with no mobilizing force. And it is important to note the difference
between this image of Bernie and the photo of a defiant Trump with blood on
his ear and cheek, being rushed off stage by Secret Service agents, fist raised
with an American flag in the background. Although this photo also became
instantly iconic, it did not acquire the same mobilizing force as the much more
modest, less spectacular, photo of Bernie sitting alone.3
   Perhaps, we can also say that paraconsistency belongs to the field some
call “metamodernism.” Metamodernism presents itself as a dialectical
“negation of negation” of modernism: postmodernism negates modernism
(traditional rationalist progressism) with ironic deconstruction or historicist
relativization of modernist universal rationalism, while metamodernism
brings postmodernism to its immanent self-negation, maintaining its critical
stance but combining it with a reassertion of hope and positive values which
survive relativist deconstruction—it is not enough to demonstrate how every
366                               Quantum History


ideology is rooted in a particular socio-symbolic context, one also has
to translate this demonstration into a positive ethico-political stance.
Metamodernism mostly locates this stance in a reference to authentic
subjectivity, as well as in ecological concerns or social solidarity . . .
                                      *
There are two problems with this notion of metamodernism. First, according to
the definition given above, were Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud not already
metamodernists, even though they preceded postmodernism? Moreover, was
Hegel himself not the first major metamodernist, since his dialectical procedure
endeavours precisely to undermine every fixed universal notion? Second,
modernism is not the beginning of the story but a reaction to the vast field
usually referred to as “traditional societies”—and is our time not characterized
precisely by a weird co-existence of postmodern cynicism and a resuscitated
premodern fundamentalism? If—as Fred Jameson pointed out—postmodernism
introduced a false permissiveness (everything is permitted on condition that it
does not disturb the free circulation of the capital, all “subversive” acts are even
solicited insofar as they can be integrated into the self-reproductive movement
of the capital), an exemplary feature of metamodernist ideology is the so-called
Cancel Culture in which exclusion, brutal censorship, is reintroduced on behalf
of inclusion and diversity themselves: you are excluded if you do not fit our
definition of inclusion and diversity. To put it in another way, while
postmodernism stands for the (appearance of the) end of history when all
epochs coexist in an eternal Now, metamodernism designates a return of history
with its radical breaks, tensions and antagonisms, something nicely captured by
the term “bend of History”:

   A bending of History may simultaneously imply forcing History into a
   different direction or shape as well as causing History to deflect from
   the more or less straight line of teleological narrative. It also captures the
   increasing awareness across culture that there is something at stake, yet we
   are still very much unsure what this something—hidden around the bend,
   as it were—might be (and we will only really know in hindsight).4

In quantum mechanics, paraconsistency resides in the parallax gap between
our common reality and the quantum proto-reality means that each domain

is contained in its opposite. As Bohr liked to repeat, the only reality that exists
for us is our common reality, and all we know about quantum proto-reality
are the measurement data we see in our common reality—they appear
within a frame, i.e., on a screen of our measuring devices. At the same time
the implicit ontological premise of quantum mechanics is that what we
perceive (and interact with) as reality is the outcome of the collapse of wave
functions, so that—as, among others, Rovelli claims—the ultimate reality is
that of the complex network of wave oscillations, and our common reality is
something that appears (and exists) only within the frame generated by wave
oscillations. This duality is strictly homologous to the duality of nature and
culture: human culture is part of nature since nature is “all there is,” but at the
same time, to paraphrase Lukacs, nature is a cultural category, i.e., what we
perceive as “natural” is always overdetermined by a social-cultural historical
context.
   Consequently, paraphrasing Lacan’s well known “Kant avec Sade”, we should
say “Gettier with Rumsfeld.” A brief reminder: back in 1963, Edmund Gettier
imagined counterexamples which challenge the predominant justified-true-
belief (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is
equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth,
and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim.
Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are
cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but
still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out
to be false—the JTB account is thus inadequate because it does not account for
all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.5
                                     *
Here is one counterexample: I am interviewed for a job and I am told by the
interviewer that my answers were excellent so that the job is mine for sure; on
my way out, I put my hand into my pocket and discover that I have there two
coins, so I conclude that the person who will get the job has two coins in his
pocket. What then happens is that there was another guy interviewed after me
and he was even better than me, so that he got the job; on the top of it, by a
strange coincidence this guy also has two coins in his pocket. All three
conditions of true knowledge are thus met: I know the guy who got the job has
368                              Quantum History


two coins in his pocket, the guy really has two coins in his pocket, and my
claim that he has two coins in his pocket is justified (I reached this conclusion
with clear reasoning)—however, intuition tells me that we are dealing here
with a rare coincidence so that we cannot really say that I knew the guy who
got the job has two coins in his pocket.
   Among the dozens of attempts to resolve the problem by way of redefining
knowledge, the predominant one adds a fourth condition which concerns
causal power: my justification of a fact must designate the true cause of that fact.
This condition is clearly not met in our counterexample: my justification (I
checked my pocket and there were two coins in it) has nothing to do with the
fact that the winner (not me) had two coins in his pocket . . . Instead of proposing
the right solution, I’ll limit myself here to the obvious fact that at least two
further distinctions are needed here: between belief and opinion (which are
both unjustified in the usual sense of the term), and between knowledge in the
strict sense of the world (the French savoir) and a more vague sense of knowing
something or someone (the French connaissance). An authentic religious belief
is not only not justified in the usual sense of the term, true theologians even
despise so-called rational proofs of god’s existence as an obscene abomination:
belief is not a matter of objectively knowing that something is true, it implies
full subjective engagement (which is why the statement “I know god exists but I
don’t believe in him” is one of the most brutal expressions of radical atheism).
The same holds for political engagement: if I say “I believe people are equal,” I
am not asking for a further justification in order to make this belief true
knowledge—“I believe people are equal” is a political stance, a norm to which I
am fully committed, not a statement of objective knowledge.
   Belief is also to be distinguished from opinion (a not fully justified
presumption)—say, I think Trump really lost the 2020 presidential elections,
but this opinion is not grounded in my detailed knowledge, I’ve just decided to
trust the media reports. Another distinction is here the already-mentioned one
between savoir (strict knowledge) and connaissance (connaitre in the sense of
knowing someone, being acquainted with him): there is no contradiction in
saying “Yes, I know that guy, but I don’t really know him.” Say, I know my
neighbour, I met him regularly on the stairs, we nod to each other, but I know
practically nothing about him.
                                      Conclusion                                   369


   Then there are rumours6 which function in a strange way with regard to
truth: the fact itself, the factual truth of a rumour, is suspended (or, rather,
treated as indifferent—“I don’t know if it is true, but this is what I heard . . .”),
while the content of a rumour retains its full symbolic efficiency—we enjoy
them, retelling them with passion. So it’s not the same as the fetishist disavowal
(“I know very well it’s not ture, nonetheless . . . I believe in it’’), but, again, its
inversion, something like “I cannot say that I believe this is true, this really
happened, but nonetheless . . . here is what I know.” With regard to the exercise
of power, the space of rumours is ambiguous. “Dirty” rumours can sustain
power and its authority (from Ataturk to Tito), but rumours also play an often
decisive role in unrests and revolutionary upheavals, inclusive of anti-
immigrant revolts (Europe is now full of rumours of immigrants raping our
women, and of how authorities censor news about these rapes). There are also
what one may be tempted to call “good rumours” which are needed to trigger
a revolutionary explosion. Exemplary here is the Great Fear (la Grande Peur),
the general panic that took place between July 17 and August 3, 1789, at the
start of the French Revolution:

   Rural unrest had been present in France since the worsening grain shortage
   of the spring, and, fueled by rumors of an aristocrats’ “famine plot” to starve
   or burn out the population, both peasants and townspeople mobilized in
   many regions. In response to these rumors, fearful peasants armed
   themselves in self-defense and, in some areas, attacked manor houses. The
   content of the rumors differed from region to region—in some areas it was
   believed that a foreign force was burning the crops in the fields, while in
   other areas it was believed that robbers were burning buildings.7

From what we know, there was no “famine plot,” and the very fact that the
content of rumours varied demonstrates their factual non-truth: however,
even if false (“fake news”), they played an indispensable role in mobilizing
the people. Every revolutionary upheaval, from the October Revolution to the
Khomeini movement overthrowing the regime of the Shah in Iran, was also a
conflict of rumours. During the October Revolution, rumours were circulating
that Bolshevik units were commanded by German officers, etc., together with
rumours that drunken Bolsheviks were serially raping women . . .
370                              Quantum History


   What complicates things further is the precise reflexive status of my
knowledge: is being aware of some knowledge necessary for it to qualify as
knowledge? This brings us again to “Gettier with Rumsfeld”—back in March
2003, Rumsfeld engaged in a little bit of amateur philosophizing about the
relationship between the known and the unknown: “There are known knowns.
These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to
say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown
unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know.”8 What he forgot to
add was the crucial fourth term: the “unknown knowns,” things we don’t know
that we know—which is precisely the Freudian unconscious, the “knowledge
which doesn’t know itself,” as Lacan used to say. If Rumsfeld thought that the
main dangers in the confrontation with Iraq were the “unknown unknowns,”
the threats from Saddam we were not even aware of, our reply should be that
the main dangers were, on the contrary, the “unknown knowns,” the disavowed
beliefs and suppositions we are not even aware of adhering to ourselves. This
distinction between unknown unknowns and unknown knowns is today more
pertinent than ever. In the case of ecology, disavowed beliefs and suppositions
are the ones which prevent us from taking seriously the prospect of a
catastrophe. So let me propose here my own thought experiment on “Gettier
with Rumsfeld” which involves racism or sexism and works in both ways. Let’s
imagine a black single mother applied for a job, was fully qualified for it
(surpassing all competitors), and got it: a sexist racist may claim that she didn’t
really get the job because she was qualified for it but because she was a black
woman. Or the opposite case: she wasn’t the most qualified for the job and she
didn’t get it, but a feminist anti-racist will claim that the real reason she didn’t
get the job is, again, that she was a black woman.
   Things get here very complicated—first, how does affirmative action work? Is
it just that between equally qualified persons we should choose the (racially,
sexually . . .) underprivileged one, or is it that the underprivileged status can to
some extent prevail over qualifications? There are some arguments for this more
radical stance: the features we rely on in measuring qualification are often not
socially neutral—which is also why some versions of John Rawls’s famous
principle of the“veil of ignorance”(not knowing some things like colourblindness)
cannot and should not always be applied. Unknown knowns are not just a
                                     Conclusion                                  371


negative feature (unconscious prejudices, etc.); they can also play a different role.
What if deep in my psyche I know that I did something horrible and inexcusable,
and while I rationalized this betrayal by a series of arguments which make it
acceptable, the pressure of guilt secretly permeates my entire life.
   The status of true knowledge is in itself ambiguous, not only in the obvious
sense that, while all the data I enumerate are true, the selection of some data
and ignorance of other data betray a hidden (or even not so hidden) bias.
Knowledge doesn’t concern just individuals: it is a social fact embedded in the
predominant notion of the big Other. Let’s take the obvious example: yes, the
Earth circulates around the Sun, but only if we accept in advance the
coordinates of classical modern physics—the moment relativity theory and
quantum mechanics enter the game, such statements should be qualified.
However, in our common universe, it is accepted as a fact that the Earth
circulates around the Sun.
   Does this imply epistemic or moral relativism? Does it mean that what is at
one level a terrible crime is at another level a neutral fact? The best-known
example: if brain science demonstrates that there is no free will, was then
Hitler really responsible for Shoah? Is it not all too easy to reply that we have
to distinguish levels here (in our human universe, Hitler was evil, while as a
living organism his freedom was just a “user’s illusion”): brain science pretends
to explain how the experience of freedom as a “user’s illusion” emerges out of
and is a moment of natural mechanisms. This is why even those who reject free
will resort to evoking complex inscrutability of our brain processes to leave
some space open for freedom—here is an exemplary case of this strategy:

   So there is no “ghost” inside the cerebral machine. But as researchers, we
   argue that this machinery is so complex, inscrutable, and mysterious that
   popular concepts of “free will” or the “self ” remain incredibly useful. They
   help us think through and imagine—albeit imperfectly—the workings of
   the mind and brain. As such, they can guide and inspire our investigations
   in profound ways—provided we continue to question and test these
   assumptions along the way.9

While here is not the place to confront these deadlocks,10 what we must insist
on is that complexity and inscrutability are not just an effect of the limitation
372                               Quantum History


of our knowledge—they reside in the thing itself. True knowledge and freedom
are proofs that reality itself is antinomic and “contradictory” in the Hegelian
sense—in short, that it is paraconsistent. With the wonderful irreverence that
is so rare among today’s Leftists due to our Cancel Culture, Alain Badiou
asserts that philosophy emerged in Ancient Greece:

   I, for one, can say that in pre-colonial Africa, or even in ancient China, there
   was no philosophy at all, without feeling guilty of cultural colonialism, and
   actually without feeling guilty of anything.11

Why? Because philosophy can only emerge when two conditions are met:
democracy and mathematics. Badiou immediately notices the tension between
these two conditions: freedom implies indeterminacy and chaos, while
mathematics implies following rules and the procedures of demonstration.
(More precisely, “freedom” stands here for a gap between truth and power:
truth is not dependent on some higher authority—god, state power and its
institutions—but should be demonstrated with rational reasoning. This is why
Badiou also claims that mathematics itself begins in Ancient Greece: only
there mathematical axioms become something to be demonstrated—this
is not what we get in much praised ancient Indian or Arab mathematics.
Even the great Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920), praised as “the man who
knew infinity”—reshaped twentieth-century mathematics with his various
contributions in several mathematical domains, including mathematical
analysis, infinite series, continued fractions, number theory, and game
theory—is regularly reproached for just formulating his intuitions without any
formal procedures of demonstration.)
   This “Eurocentrism” is already detectable in the triadic structure of the
present book. Let me attempt the impossible and provide a brief description of
the basic ontological premise of all my work, the premise best rendered by
Mladen Dolar’s thesis that being is a failed nothing.12 One could also add here
Emil Cioran’s notion of the “inconvenience of existence,” and, of course, Peter
Wessel Zapffe, a Norwegian thinker for whom humanity is “an evolutionary
error”—its excessive self-awareness may appear to heighten its chances of
survival, but it effectively limits its ability to act.13 Let me emphasize that there
is absolutely no contradiction between such a “pessimist” view and a dedication
                                       Conclusion                               373


to Communism: today’s Communist has to accept the immanent despair of
the human condition and propose Communism as a strategy to cope with it.
   In other words, one should drop the implicit humanist optimism of the
standard Left: a human being has the potential for a happy life, for solidarity
and cooperation, suffering and despair predominate just in alienated societies
. . . Without asserting the tendency towards evil as constitutive of being human
(the figure of a utilitarian-egotist human nature is clearly a product of capitalist
modernity), one should unconditionally abandon the idea of some essential
creative potential of human beings which is thwarted in capitalism. This idea
was superbly deployed in Ray Brassier’s outstanding Fatelessness: Freedom and
Fatality After Marx, where he systematically and in a true philosophical spirit
demonstrates how the Marxist concept of deactualization “challenges Hegel’s
yoking of possibility to actuality”:

   capital is not just a loosely coordinated aggregate of social phenomena but
   a self-reproducing social totality that, although of historically recent
   provenance, is compelled to subordinate the present and future of human
   history to ensure its own perpetuity. Thus capital is not just one of a
   succession of shapes of spirit but its fatal estrangement; a specific mode of
   production that coopts generic human productivity (human genus being or
   Gattungwesen) for its own limitless yet pointless expansion. . . . Thus
   humanity’s actualization in and through capital (working to live) is coupled
   to capital’s actualization in and through humanity (the exploitation of
   labour). But there is an asymmetry in this coupling because while labour’s
   actualization actualizes capital, the actualization of capital simultaneously
   actualizes and deactualizes labour.14

From my standpoint, Brassier here re-Aristotelianizes Marx, mobilizing the
tension between the essential possibility of being-human and its contingent
actualization. For Hegel actualization is a truth of a possibility, i.e., it brings
out what a possibility effectively amounted to—say, from Hegel’s standpoint,
Stalinism was the truth of the Leninist (or even Marxist) project, not just its
secondary deviation. For Marx, there is a split in every actualization, and this
split becomes palpable in capitalism: the creative potential that defines being-
human and tends towards its actualization effectively is actualized in capitalism
374                              Quantum History


(workers collectively produce immense material and spiritual wealth), but this
actualization is simultaneously the workers’s de-actualiztion, their reduction
to poor, suffering, dominated and exploited instruments of capital’s self-
reproduction. This de-actualization is not necessary, it is necessary just for the
reproduction of capital, while from the creative human essence immanently
contains the possibility of eradicating contingent suffering and domination—a
revolutionary effort is sustained precisely by the awareness that the capitalist
actualization is something historically contingent that could be abolished.
   I think this critique of Hegel should be rejected from the very Marxist
standpoint: in Grundrisse Marx makes it clear that only in and through
capitalism the working class emerges as a substance-less subjectivity which
can then (through the revolutionary act as a collective subject) re-appropriate
its alienated substance as its own product. Exploitation and domination are
thus necessary for human actuality: they give rise to the subject of potential
liberation, and this is why Marx even says that capitalism is already liberation
in itself (and will become for itself through a revolution). Pre-capitalist
societies are less “alienated” than capitalism because in them workers are
not excluded from objective social totality, they are just still reduced to
moments of the organic social process of production, i.e., they still appear to
have their proper place within a social totality and are not reduced to a “place
of no-place.”
   One should be careful not to confuse this movement with the standard
misunderstanding of the Hegelian triad: it is not that the (collective) subject
objectivizes itself in its product in which he no longer recognizes itself and
thus (mis)perceives it as an alien entity, finally recognizing itself in it and
appropriating it as its own product. There is no subject prior to alienation: it is
the process of alienation itself which creates the subject in its distinction to
objective order.
   To follow this through as far as it goes, what happens in the third moment
of a dialectical movement is neither that the subject recognizes itself in its
other, appropriates it as its own product, nor does the subject recognize itself
in its other in the sense of acquitting a fixed proper place in it. The solution is
a properly Hegelian one: the subject recognizes itself in the lack/inconsistency/
impossibility that traverses the Other, it experiences itself as correlative to the
                                    Conclusion                                 375


lack in/of the Other. This solution implies that the only appropriate ontological
stance of revolutionary Marxism is a radical ontological pessimism, which is
why another key name must be added to the list of ontological pessimists:
Philipp Mainländer, a more or less forgotten German “philosopher of
pessimism” from the mid-nineteenth century who split from Schopenhauer.
While Mainländer follows Schopenhauer in his basic claim that the only
redemption is death, a return to void, for him Will is not not a will to live
(which we should fight to extinguish it) but the will to die, to vanish.
   So how did our world of suffering arise in the first place? In a crazy cosmic
extrapolation, Mainländer interprets creation as a kind of Big Bang in which the
singularity of god (a name for the primordial Void) exploded, i.e., in which he
killed himself, dispersed himself into a chaotic multitude: “The world is nothing
but the decaying corpse of God.” And since “non-being is better than being,” all
of creation strives to return to the primordial Void.15 Here we should disagree
with Mainländer: the explosion does not follow the divine Void, it is itself the
primordial fact—this is the only way to reply to the obvious counter-argument:
why did god not remain a peaceful Void? Yes, the primordial fact is death drive,
but death drive is not (as Freud himself sometimes misunderstands his own
discovery) a tendency towards nirvana, it is uncannily close to an obscene
immortality, a drive which persists beyond the circle of life and death.
   Mainländer’s philosophy was for him not just a theory, it involved a full
engagement (like Otto Weininger’s thought): the day he received copies of his
Philosophy of Redemption, he accepted that he had done what he could for the
benefit of humanity and decided to kill himself—he hanged himself on April
1, 1876 (the fool’s day!). But here comes a big surprise: he considered another
way that he could remain useful to humanity and go on living, a radical Leftist
political engagement. (He did not take this path because his sister to whom he
was very close opposed Leftist politics.) The contrast between Mainländer and
Schopenhauer’s political conservativism and anti-feminism strikes the eye: for
Mainländer, the fact that for a large majority of people life is one long suffering
and misery pushed him to social engagement to lessen suffering—a convincing
case of how ontological pessimism goes hand in hand with compassionate
radical politics. Mainländer goes very far in this direction, he argues not only
against Schopenhauer but also against Buddhism:
376                              Quantum History


   while these systems provide pathways for individual alleviation of suffering,
   they fall short of addressing the broader societal implications of existential
   suffering. He contends that such quietisms can perpetuate injustice by
   failing to empower those who lack the means to achieve personal moral
   development. For Mainländer, the ethical pursuit of personal goodness
   must be accompanied by a commitment to social justice, ensuring that all
   individuals have access to the education and resources necessary to develop
   an awareness of the lack of value of life.

The central premise of Mainländer’s activism is thus that a truly pessimistic
ethics must advocate for the dismantling of social and political structures that
perpetuate inequality and suffering: the pursuit of social and political equality
is a natural extension of the compassion that arises from recognizing existence
as fundamentally evil. This perspective leads him to champion not only
Communism but also the free love movement (freie Liebe), including feminism
and gay rights, as essential components of a just society: “Communism serves
as a vehicle for achieving social and economic equality, allowing individuals to
transcend the selfish impulses inherent in the will to survive. By eliminating
class distinctions and ensuring equal access to education and resources,
Mainländer believes that society can cultivate a collective commitment to
alleviating suffering.”16 Should we be surprised that two great figures of the
German Social Democracy in the late nineteenth century, August Bebel and
Eduard Bernstein, sympathized with Mainländer? Today, in a society in which
the striving for pleasure and happiness fully display their self-destructive
potential, only figures like Mainländer can save us.
                                      *
To return to the main thrust of my argument, the only candidate for being as a
non-failed nothing that I know would be viruses like Covid: they are beings in
which nothing (force of destruction) succeeded17; plus one may add abortion.
In Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus, the Chorus says: “Not to be born at all / Is
best, far best that can befall”—could these famous chorus lines not be actualized
today as the best argument for abortion? “Do you worry about the kind of
world your child will live in? We can secure its greatest luck by aborting it . . .”
All positively-existing entities are quite literally less than nothing, they emerge

because of the immanent antagonism/contradiction that cuts across the
primordial void, the tension between the void in the sense of the Buddhist
sunyata (the primordial void as the background of all ephemeral appearances
that exist only in their interrelations) and the void in the sense of self-relating
negativity, a singularity that excludes and threatens to destroy all positive
content. This tension between the all-encompassing Void of eternal pace and
void of negativity, a point of pure singularity, is the ultimate identity of the
opposites, a new version of the first couple of Hegel’s logic, Being and
Nothingness, a pre-dialectical tension which sustains all dialectical process:

   Pure Being and pure nothing are, therefore, the same. What is the truth is
   neither being nor nothing, but that being—does not pass over but has passed
   over—into nothing, and nothing into being. But it is equally true that they are
   not undistinguished from each other, that, on the contrary, they are not the
   same, that they are absolutely distinct, and yet that they are unseparated and
   inseparable and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite.18

The key claim in this quote is that being “does not pass over but has passed over”
into nothing: it is a pre-dialectical passage which always-already took place. This
dimension is missing in Rovelli’s Helgoland where, in order to explain his notion
of interrelatedness of all entities, i.e., of how every entity is what it is only in its
relations with all others (in itself it is a void), he enthusiastically refers to Nagarjuna,
the great Mahayana Buddhist.19 It is because of this tension in the void itself that
we should reject all stories of the Origin, of a Fall from some primordial peace, or,
more appropriate to our times, the idea that wave oscillations are the ultimate true
reality, the productive origin of everything, and object of our ordinary reality just
the (ontologically) secondary “objectification” (reification) of the primary
productive flow, the result of its collapse, a kind of ontological Fall of the primordial
productivity. The fluid domain of wave oscillation is in itself an index of instability
and tension, wave oscillations in their multiplicity of superpositions are the
reaction to a fundamental impossibility. Collapses of wave functions are local and
ultimately failed attempts to stabilize the situation, to resolve the (pre)ontological
tension that permeates the quantum domain. So we have, roughly said, three
domains or levels: the absolute contradiction of the primordial void, quantum
oscillations, our ordinary reality.
378                              Quantum History


   As we have already seen, Rovelli seems to come dangerously close to the
typical modern view which turns around the traditional view of material
things which all the time change as originating from an eternal immovable
Absolute: what we get in modernity is the idea that fixed self-identical objects,
material things, are a “reified” result of a fluid non-substantial productive
process—movement comes before fixed identity. My Lacanian counterpoint is
that one should introduce here the distinction between objects in reality and
what Lacan, following Freud, called the Thing (das Ding), the impossible Real
Thing which coincides with its own opposite, the Thing which has no
substantial content but stands for pure difference. It is because the quantum
processes are always-already haunted by this gap of the Thing that they
immanently tend to collapse in order to resolve their constitutive tension—or,
as Schelling put it two centuries back, because of this gap or tension there is a
“hunger to be something” in every Nothing.
   The next key point is that we should not see these three levels as three steps
in the self-deployment of the Absolute: the circular logic of retroactivity is at
work here also. The primordial Void is also a retroactive product of the failure
of quantum wave to actualize their potentials, the point of impossibility around
which they circulate, and these waves themselves can also be conceived as a
cloud of virtualities which float around a real object or process. And this brings
us also to history and politics proper. Read against the background of such
quantum ontology, history is a process whose necessity and direction are
always determined retroactively: once the multiplicity of options collapses in a
contingent way, the past is structured as a necessary process that had to lead to
the present state of things. And, last but not least, this collapse is not a neutral
“objective” process but a contingent political act.20
   This is how we are to understand more closely the triadic structure of this
book: quantum inspired ontology as the new form of dialectical materialism;
historical materialism reconstructed so that it excludes the progressive-
evolutionist aspects of traditional Marxism; chances of radical emancipatory
acts today. This structure of UPS is not that of a linear progress: it is not that
we (in the logical order) first formulate a general ontological vision, then we
apply this vision to social development, and finally we draw from it political
implications. (If a reader will take the book in this way, s/he deserves a lifelong

place in gulag.) The notion of hologram, retroactivity, and the collapse of
superpositions, the central motif of the book, also underlies its tripartite
structure: a radical political act is the singular point which retroactively
grounds its historical and philosophical superpositions. The true starting point
is thus not a panoramic view of the entire cosmos but the unbearable tension
of a political moment, of what Walter Benjamin called Jetztzeit:—let me
shamelessly quote the Oxford Reference description:

  a notion of time that is ripe with revolutionary possibility, time that has
  been detached from the continuum of history. It is time at a standstill,
  poised, filled with energy, and ready to take what Benjamin called the “tiger’s
  leap” into the future. It isn’t naturally occurring, however, and takes the
  intervention of the artist or revolutionary to produce it by “blasting” it free
  from the ceaseless flow in which it would otherwise be trapped. Benjamin
  contrasts Jetztzeit with the “homogeneous empty time” of the ruling class,
  which is history written from the perspective of the victors.21

So it is not only quantum physics which describes the level where the linear
flow of time is suspended—at the opposite end of quantum speculations,
in a moment of extreme political engagement, we find a homologous paradox.
This in no way implies historicist relativization—our historical moment
is unique, a moment at which god (the big Other) is effectively dead, at which
the death of god became a moment of our social life itself, not just a brief
traumatic experience covered up by new illusions. In some sense which is far
from merely metaphorical, god is dead and we are dead with it. If we still live,
we are living dead. Being undead is our only space of freedom—or, to quote
James Baldwin:

  Any real change implies the breakup of the world as one has always known
  it, the loss of all that gave one an identity, the end of safety. And at such a
  moment, unable to see and not daring to imagine what the future will now
  bring forth, one clings to what one knew, or dreamed that one possessed.
  Yet, it is only when a man is able, without bitterness or self-pity, to surrender
  a dream he has long possessed that he is set free, he has set himself free for
  higher dreams.22

Is my ultimate stance then a pessimist one? Yes and no. Yes, since I am ready to
renounce the standard Leftist idea that, at some point in the future, the majority
of the people will awaken, throw off the shackles of the ruling ideology and
engage in radical emancipatory action. What we are witnessing now is a step in
the opposite direction: a gradual normalization of Rightist and Leftist “excesses”
(like Fascism and Stalinism). Although Alternative for Germany from time to
time slips into open racism, it mostly speaks a “civilized” moderate language.
Even the radical Left is recently trying to normalize itself: there is a new tendency
on the fringes of our political spectrum, something we cannot but call a
“moderate far Left”; its main proponents are Domenico Losurdo (who recently
died) and Gabriel Rockhill (who analyzed the link between Adorno and
Horkheimer and the CIA, and also dismissed me as “capitalist’s court jester”).
   This tendency is far Left because it breaks the firewall that defined the post-
World War II Western Left: it rehabilitates “really existing Socialism,” inclusive
of Stalin and Mao. But it does this not in exalted Stalinist language: its language
is that of moderation and non-dogmatic realist pragmatism, so that it’s not so
much a rehabilitation but rather the normalization of Stalinism and Maoism.
Stalinism should be viewed as one of the stages in the complex development of
Socialism; yes, it had its excesses, but also its great achievements, and it emerged
as an understandable reaction to the boycott and pressure on Socialist
countries. This is how the followers of this line explain the repressive features
of the Socialist regimes (strong secret police, etc.): they construct a narrative
which I find thoroughly ridiculous: when revolutionaries took power, they
thought they were now in a free society, but they were soon compelled to
realize that they were under siege, encircled by internal and external enemies
bent on their destruction through direct military intervention, economic
boycott, corruption, etc.
   The sad conclusion was that, in order to survive and protect their revolution,
they also needed secret police and other means of social control and oppression
. . . 23 In a similar vein, the deadly excesses of the Chinese revolutions (like the
tens of millions of dead in the “great leap forward” in late 1950s) are dismissed
as part of the contradictory gradual development of Socialism, with the
oscillation between two extremes (revolutionary terror and a partial return to
capitalist economy) . . . it is easy to recognize in this normalization an exact

mirror-image of the far Right attempts to “normalize” Fascism by situating it
into its historical context.
   What I find problematic is the suggestion that the revolutionaries enjoyed
an intermediary state of naïve belief that they and their society were now free.
There was no utopian moment of freedom; even before their victory, the
revolutionaries were well aware of the necessary terror and well prepared to
apply it. The first thing to do to clarify this mess is to problematize democracy
itself (at least the way this term functions today)—one has to gather the
courage to reject the simple explanation that what is missing is the mobilization
of the people, a true democracy sustained by the popular engagement. If there
is a lesson to be learned from the latest Right-populist protests, it is that the
time has come to turn around what Abraham Lincoln once said: “You can fool
all people some of the time and some people all of the time. But you can never
fool all people all of the time.” Today’s version is: most people can avoid being
fooled some of the time and some people can avoid being fooled all the time.
But most people can never avoid being fooled all the time.
   The classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of
a continuous quantity. At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated
in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox; the median
guess, 1,207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1,198 pounds.
However, one should note that in this case each person made its estimation alone,
without consulting others: when individuals were allowed to consult with each
other prior to making their guess, the accuracy of the median guess decreased
considerably—a convincing argument against the free debate prior to making a
choice.24 It’s difficult not to draw the obvious link to the low quality of democratic
choices in our era of Facebook, X, Instagram, and other “free” digital links.
                                *
A genuine emancipatory engagement of the people is a rare event which
quickly disintegrates. And we are not talking only about Western democracy
here: recall how, in the time of the Cultural Revolutions, Mao Ze-dong was
sending thousands of intellectuals to the agricultural communes to learn from
ordinary farmers whom he elevated into “subjects supposed to know”—one
can argue that it was good for intellectuals to get acquainted with the actual life
on the countryside, but what they definitely did not get is some deeper wisdom
382                              Quantum History


about social life. Today, there is no privileged group which harbors an authentic
understanding of society.
   To be more precise, it’s not so much that the majority is fooled, it is that they
basically don’t care—their main concern is that the relatively stable daily life
goes on unperturbed. The majority doesn’t want actual democracy in which
they would really decide: they want the appearance of democracy where they
freely vote, but some higher authority which they trust presents them with a
choice and indicates how they should vote. When the majority doesn’t get such
clear hints, people get perplexed and the situation in which they are supposed
to really decide is paradoxically experienced as a crisis of democracy, as a threat
to the stability of the system. However, when the so-called silent majority begins
to care, when they feel like victims and explode in real anger, things as a rule get
much worse. As the ongoing wave of Rightist populism vastly demonstrates,
they expose themselves even more to manipulation, falling prey to conspiracy
theories. If we read Hamlet’s well-known line (from act 1, scene 4) about the
custom being “more honored in the breach than in the observance” as “it is a
custom that would be better honored by breaking rather than adhering to,” might
we then not say that today democracy itself is more honored in the breach
(when its rules are not respected) than in the strict observance of its rules? We
should not be afraid to go to the end in this line and assume the lesson rendered
long ago by Athena towards the end of Aeschylos’ Eumenides:

   As for terror, / don’t banish it completely from the city. / What mortal man
   is truly righteous / without being afraid? Those who sense the fear / revere
   what’s right. With citizens like these / your country and your city will be
   safe, / stronger than anything possessed by men.25

We should understand here fear not as being afraid of singular powerful
persons, but as being afraid of a strong social organization which is today
needed more than ever—Kurt Vonnegut was right when he wrote: “There is no
reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of anything is a
matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are
organized along the lines of the Mafia.” Only in this way we’ll be able to cope
with the catastrophes that are awaiting us. What is missing in today’s mess is
not some larger unity but its very opposite. Alain Badiou was right to say that
                                    Conclusion                                  383


true ideas are those which enable us to draw the true line of division, a division
that really matters, that defines what a political struggle is really about—and
today’s hegemonic Master-Signifiers (freedom, democracy, solidarity, justice
. . .) are no longer able to do this (if they were ever able to do it is another
question). “Democracy” is regularly used to justify neocolonialism, plus some
hardline Socialist countries (East Germany, North Korea . . .) called themselves
democratic. “Freedom” is often used as an argument against public healthcare
(“it limits our freedom of choice”) or universal public education, “justice” can
also mean “everyone should act according to his/her/their proper place in
social hierarchy,” etc. To confront the great challenges today, it is crucial to
learn to draw the proper lines of division—the old motto “United we stand,
divided we fall” should be turned around: divided we stand, united we fall.
   And I am not a pessimist precisely because my pessimism is much deeper
that the usual one: I see the existing global system gradually moving towards
its own self-destruction. The main threat to it are not external enemies but its
own self-undermining dynamic. The more and more obvious global dangers
(environmental destruction, global war, the role of Artificial Intelligence, etc.)
will lead to a growth of fear and horror, to some kind of permanent emergency
state, and this fear is deeply ambiguous. It may give rise to a new authoritarianism
or chaotic world order, or it may sober up people and compel them to engage
themselves for a simple survival. So how should we (by “we”, I mean those who
perceive these dangers as a serious threat) react to this situation? The
commonsense answer—keep a cool head, carefully analyze the situation and
see what can realistically be done—is obviously too flat: everybody would in
principle agree with it, which makes it toothless. A much better approach is to
see what options are at our disposal—as far as I can see, there are three:

   – Outright denial: it’s all overblown, let’s just carry on with our lives as
       usual. This strategy is mostly used by the new Right and its conspiracy
       theories (climate change denialism, vaccinations are the cause of
       autism, etc), although recently Leftist versions have also begun to
       emerge (variations on the theme that the ecological panic, Covid
       pandemic, and the war in Ukraine are all inventions by big capital to
       keep workers under control).
384                              Quantum History


   – A fascination with the apocalyptic threat that accepts it as inevitable
      and something, perversely, which we are to enjoy. This stance is, of
      course, rarely formulated in an explicit way, but it often pervades our
      thinking as its obscure foundation.
   – The third and most interesting option: disavowal. As Alenka Zupančič26
      demonstrated, disavowal best renders the structure underlying our
      contemporary social response to traumatic and disturbing events, from
      climate change to unsettling tectonic shifts in our social tissue. Unlike
      denialism and negation, disavowal functions by fully acknowledging
      what we disavow—its logic is that of the well-known French phrase je
      sais bien, mais quand meme . . ., “I know very well (it’s true), but all the
      same (I don’t really believe in it).” Such a stance is fast becoming the
      predominant mode in which we live our social and political lives. We
      see it lived out among the vast swathes of people who fully accept
      climate change and impending environmental collapse as scientific
      realities, but nevertheless continue to reproduce, drive cars, eat meat,
      rely on technologies and so on, just as if the planet’s resources are
      limitless rather than exhausted: “I know very well we are in serious
      trouble with our environment, but nonetheless . . . (life must go on, our
      individual desires are still worth pursuing, fundamentally it’s business
      as usual).”

How are we to counteract this disavowal? Not just by simply taking our
knowledge seriously, without disavowal, but by enacting the opposite disavowal:
we knew well that the situation is desperate, that what awaits us is a catastrophe,
but nonetheless we should act with full engagement to prevent it. How can this
apparently irrational strategy work? Because the knowledge contained in “of
course, we know very well” is not neutral: its objectivity is already biased. What
we “know very well,” what is “obvious,” what is accepted as a matter of course,
is not written in stone, but in shifting sand; it is a socially-constructed shared
hegemonic opinion which obfuscates its owns cracks and inconsistencies in
order to seem immutable, and our task is to change it. The point is not to
provide “alternate facts,” but to undermine the framing that makes us select
some facts and ignore others. This is why we are not dealing here with the
                                    Conclusion                                  385


usual disavowal but with a courageous act of taking a risk and ignoring our
apparent limitations. Our stance should be: we know we appear weak and
divided, but we should nevertheless do what has to be done. We know (or feel
with the force of seeming knowledge) that we cannot avert environmental
collapse, but we should still take the actions that would give us the best chance
of doing so. In such a situation where apocalypse is on the horizon, one should
bear in mind that the standard logic of probability no longer applies—we need
a different logic described by Jean-Pierre Dupuy:

   The catastrophic event is inscribed into the future as a destiny, for sure, but
   also as a contingent accident . . . if an outstanding event takes place, a
   catastrophe, for example, it could not not have taken place; nonetheless,
   insofar as it did not take place, it is not inevitable. It is thus the event’s
   actualization—the fact that it takes place—which retroactively creates its
   necessity.27

This, according to Dupuy, is also how we should approach the prospect of
an ecological or social catastrophe: not to “realistically” appraise the likelihood
of the catastrophe, but to accept it as our fate, as unavoidable, and then, on
the basis of this acceptance, mobilize ourselves to perform the act which
will change destiny itself and thereby open up new possibilities within the
situation. Instead of saying “the future is still fluid, we still have time, time to
act and prevent the worst,” one should accept the catastrophe as inevitable
and then act to undo the destiny which is already “written in the stars”. G.K.
Chesterton saw clearly how such sober acting has to combine opposite
emotions and desires:

   A soldier surrounded by enemies, if he is to cut his way out, needs to
   combine a strong desire for living with a strange carelessness about dying.
   He must not merely cling to life, for then he will be a coward, and will
   escape. He must not merely wait for death, for then he will be a suicide, and
   will not escape. He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it;
   he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine.28

An outstanding recent movie renders perfectly such a combination of the
opposites: Oleh Sentsov’s Real which consists of 90 minutes of frontline action
386                              Quantum History


captured when he didn’t realize his camera was on. Sentsov, who spent several
years a political prisoner in Russia and is now fighting in the Ukrainian army,
found the 90 minutes of shaky footage six months after the battle while he was
on a short leave at home (he is now back on the front). He was going through
old files on his GoPro camera and realized it had been switched on that day.
Presented unedited, it manages to capture the terror and boredom of life on
the frontline: “I was about to delete everything when I found this and I realized
I had a very interesting imprint of that battle and of war how it truly is—ugly,
incomprehensible, twisted, and stupid.” “Real” of the title does not refer to any
kind of “real”—it is named after the position where the wounded men are
stuck (all the positions in the battle are named after football teams: “Real”
refers to Real Madrid). Sentsov’s position is Marseille and a nearby position is
Chelsea. The movie’s title is accurately ambiguous: the name of a big sports
club and war in its ugly, incomprehensible, twisted, and stupid nature—in
short, in its Real in the Lacanian sense.
   The same duality traverses the entire film: the meaningless and boring
brutality of the real is intercepted by magical moments of what one cannot but
designate as meaningless meaning. Sentsov recalled a moment from the same
day, which took place about an hour before the footage in Real begins. “There
was a soldier with the call sign Johnny, a veteran of the Afghan war. He was
going there to evacuate the wounded but he was hit, and he managed to make
one last radio transmission, in which he said: ‘This is Johnny. I’m dead.’”29 A
moment of an authentic metaphysical absurdity.
   Reviewers of the film often comment that Real shows “the war as it really is,”
but this claim is one-sided and deeply deceiving. If this were to be the message
of the film, it would be yet another pacifist depiction of the meaningless
absurdity of war, yet another variation on the motif “when you experience the
brutality of warfare, when you see bodies dismembered, when you hear cries
of the dying soldiers, you become aware that all the appeals to sacrifice yourself
for your country, to fulfil your highest duty, etc., are just empty phrases serving
those in power” . . . Sentsov is unique in that, while bringing out all the horror
and boredom of fighting, he doesn’t draw from this the expected cynical-
pacifist conclusion—while accepting its brutal meaninglessness, fighting for a
just cause has to go on. Deprived of all pathetic-emotional romanticization of
                                   Conclusion                                 387


the heroic fighting, Real displays what true courage means: to heroically accept
the misery of a military struggle and not to obfuscate its Real with pathetic
fantasies.
   This Real is hard to swallow without being fascinated by it. Centuries ago
the Dutch colonizers in the far East (probably Indonesia) submitted a prisoner
to a terrible water torture: they tied him to a tree and then put a narrow tube
out of which water continuously flowed into his mouth so that if he wanted to
breathe he had to swallow water. After two hours the prisoner’s belly was
overblown, but he wasn’t yet dead, and the people observing the torture took
this as a proof that he is evil, possessed by the devil who gave him the unnatural
strength to survive his ordeal—in short, instead of some compassion with the
tortured prisoner, his unexpectedly prolonged survival in terrifying pain
triggered hatred and rage . . . Is this really something alien to our enlightened
times? Is something similar not going on now, at the beginning of 2025, in
Gaza? The more the Palestinians survive the genocidal violence of the IDF in
Gaza, the more their unexpected survival is taken as a proof that they are all
Hamas supporters, while their torturers led by the war criminal Benjamin
Netanyahu fortify their status as warriors against terror. What “Israel as the
only democracy in the Middle East” actually amounts to is made clear in a
weird incident that occurred in mid-January 2025: some starving Gazans
caught a dolphin in the sea and ate it—and were immediately attacked by
some Israelis for non-ecological behaviour, as barbarians eating endangered
species.30 The horror of this attack is double: not only is it obscene to reproach
starving people for eating whatever they can get their hands on, it is even more
obscene that IDF itself changed Gaza into an area of ecological catastrophe.
The well-known joke from Ernst Lubitsch’s To Be Or Not to Be (told in the
movie by a Nazi called “concentration camp Erhardt” who terrorizes the Poles)
thus applies perfectly to “concentration-camp-Bibi”: “We do the concentrating,
Palestinians do the camping.”
   The genocidal activity of IDF in Gaza confronts us with heart of what
Markus Gabriel, a young philosopher who emerged as a superstar of German
philosophy, characterized as our “dark times”—although, Gabriel sees the
greatest manifestation of this setback in the Hamas October 7, 2023, attack, not
in what goes on in Gaza:
388                             Quantum History


   We are in the midst of a crisis of humanity on a global scale. The greatest
   manifestation of this setback is the barbaric massacre in Israel committed
   by the terrorist organization Hamas in Gaza.31

Does this passage not demonstrate that Gabriel himself is part of the ongoing
“dark times”: his judgment bears witness to a conspicuous lack of moral
universalism, of measuring different events with the same standard.

   We should assert moral universalism, but as a notion which is at the same
time necessary and impossible, penetrated by immanent tensions and
antagonism. The first step in this direction is not to conceive the perversion of
(what presents itself as) a universal value as its secondary deformation but as
something immanent to this value itself—in short, to be always attentive to the
ambiguities of any notion of progress.32 What one should avoid at any price is
a vague common sense universal progressism: a large majority of people know
what is bad and what is good, and we should just push forward in this direction,
gradually expanding solidarity and compassion . . .
   Moral universalism is not necessarily idealist, it can also be formulated
outside the space of Kantian transcendental apriorism, as moral realism
grounded in facts. Markus Gabriel, who adopts this position, assumes that
universal moral arguments are not dependent on specific historical
circumstances—if slavery is wrong now, it has always been wrong (I am
tempted to add: slavery has always been wrong measured by today’s predominant
standards). Moral categories exist independently of human beings, and they
should be obvious to everyone, even in the most oppressive circumstances.
Gabriel asserts the objectivity of moral facts, their universality, and their
essential knowability by human beings—although he concedes that in
“dark times” (like ours) they can be obscured by ideology, propaganda,
psychology and manipulation. In this way, Gabriel seems to join the ranks of
Habermasian normative progressism which can be vaguely defined by the
premise that,

   through large-scale cooperation between the humanities, the social sciences,
   and even other fields of expertise if necessary, we are able to discover
   normative facts that are guiding for nonacademic sectors.33
                                    Conclusion                                 389


Philosophy is thus no longer like the owl of Minerva, as it was for Hegel, but
future-oriented . . . how, exactly? First, how did the dark times arrive? Gabriel
provides no realist analysis, he simply claims that universal values “can be
obscured by ideology, propaganda, psychology, and manipulation”—a claim
that I consider ultra-naïve since it disregards how ideology, manipulation, etc.,
are an aspect of complex social processes which need them for their
reproduction. And the same holds for getting out of the “dark times”: what one
should change is the entire social edifice, not just the ideology that sustains it.
Can such a change really be set in motion by philosophers and social theorists?
Gabriel mentions (approvingly) Germany where politicians often seek advice
from philosophers—obviously, their advice didn’t prevent Germany from
entering a deep crisis . . . The main argument Gabriel offers for his moral
realism rests on a thought experiment called the “Day of Judgment”.: he

   asks us to consider what our reaction would be if we were facing God’s
   judgment and God commended us for all the bad things we have done and
   condemned us for the good. We would find this judgment incomprehensible.
   A god whose judgments had no continuity with our own would not be God,
   but a “terrible demon.”34

Gabriel’s notion of a Judgment Day is not as eccentric as it may appear: many
scientists refer to something similar when they talk about a (virtual, not really
existing) Book in which all the laws of nature that we are gradually discovering
are already written in their perfect form. For example, the great Hungarian
mathematician Paul Erdős,

   although an agnostic atheist, spoke of “The Book,” a visualization of a book
   in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for
   mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, “You don’t have to believe
   in God, but you should believe in The Book.” He himself doubted the existence
   of God whom he playfully nicknamed the SF (for “Supreme Fascist”).35

I immensely admire Erdős, as a person as well as a thinker; his lifestyle had
something of the practicing Communist—most of his belongings would fit in
a suitcase; he donated what he earned to people in need; and he lived an
390                              Quantum History


itinerant lifestyle, traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the
homes of friends and colleagues: “He would typically show up at a colleague’s
doorstep and announce ‘my brain is open,’ staying long enough to collaborate
on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask
the current collaborator about whom to visit next.”36 However, his idea of a
Book was a mistake—a necessary one, but nonetheless a mistake. What a truly
materialist science compels us to accept is that there is no Book, not only in
reality but also as an inaccessible ideal (therein resides the basic lesson of
quantum mechanics).
   Back to Gabriel, I reject his thought experiment with the Day of Judgment
for two reasons. If taken literally, it ignores the lesson of the Book of Job,
arguably the first text that practices critique of ideology, which is that the
discontinuity between our judgments and the putative divine judgment is
irreducible—every authentic Protestant dismisses as an obscenity the idea that
we have direct access to god’s judgment. If taken metaphorically, it relies on a
non-historical notion of big Other which is obviously ideological: every idea
of a Judgment Day (which would enable us to measure our historical moment
with standards that are in some sense absolute) is clearly marked by its own
historical moment—history and eternity are not simply exclusive, every
historical epoch creates its own notion of what is trans-historical. A clear proof
of the historical roots of Gabriel’s moral universalism, of his premise that
“moral categories exist independently of human beings, and they should be
obvious to everyone, even in the most oppressive circumstances,” is that he
ends up with a vision of ethical capitalism37—here is its brief characterization:

   Ethical Capitalism has at least two essential ingredients: a focus on creating
   long-term economic and social value, and a commitment by business to act
   as stewards of the full spectrum of its constituencies—customers, employees,
   suppliers, investors, and society. Ethical Capitalism seeks to build deep,
   trust-based relationships in the service of society as well as the bottom line.
   In other words, it is a business model with a higher purpose.38

This stance relies on a rather flat commonsense logic: capitalism is the only
thing that functions economically, but today’s capitalism privileges profit; so we
need a different capitalism which will privilege solidarity and the environment
                                     Conclusion                                  391


. . . I think the basic lesson of Marx remains fully valid here: capitalism obeys its
own immanent logic (what Adrian Johnston called the “capitalist drive”
independent of capitalists’ personal virtues or vices, a drive to expanded self-
reproduction which inherently ignores social and natural consequences39).
Mandeville’s idea of the “invisible hand of the market” implies that, pursuing
their egotist desires, individual capitalists work for the common good—but
does this still hold (or did it ever hold)? Gabriel’s notion of ethical capitalists
as the “stewards” of community (the role today played in public by Elon Musk,
Bill Gates, and other new feudal lords) pretends to turn around the logic
of the “invisible hand of the market”: acting as ethical subjects, pursuing
common good and charity, these new lords just enable the capitalist drive to
function more smoothly—no wonder they are getting richer and richer. The
axiom to be followed is here: never trust a project which relies on moral values
of individuals.
   If I remain a Marxist, then I would define myself as an anthropologically
pessimist one, and this puts me in good company: the Brechtian extraneation
is not just a procedure of acquiring intellectual distance, it is itself an emotion,
an atmospheric stance, the “feeling” that things are weird, out of joint. Therein
resides the importance of Hanns Eisler’s music to Brecht’s poems: it renders
the emotional atmosphere which fits the critical stance of extraneation. And
although Eisler was a dedicated Communist, this emotion is as far as possible
from cheap socialist optimism and trust in a bright future. For Eisler, as for any
authentic Communist, revolutionary engagement always occurs against the
background of sadness, despair even—despair at all the meaningless suffering
that abounds in the long series of catastrophes called “human history.” This
inescapable atmosphere of sadness is grounded in our finitude: there is no way
for us to extract ourselves from the texture of history and assume the external
position of an agent and observer to whom history is a transparent process.
Eisler’s two songs with words based on Pascal (nos. 17 and 18 from the
Hollywood Songbook) display a similar dark vision:

   Despite these miseries, man wishes to be happy, / and only wishes to
   be happy, and cannot wish not to be so. / But how will he set about it?
   To be happy he would have to / make himself immortal. But, not being
392                             Quantum History


  able to do so, / it has occurred to him to prevent himself from thinking
  of death
                                                                         (no. 17).

  The only thing which consoles us for our miseries is diversion, / and yet this
  is the greatest of our miseries. / For it is this which principally hinders us
  from reflecting upon ourselves, / and which makes us insensibly ruin
  ourselves. Without this / we should be in a state of weariness, and this
  weariness would spur us / to seek a more solid means of escaping from it. /
  But diversions amuse us and lead us unconsciously to death
                                                                         (no. 18).

Again, such a dark vision of humanity is the necessary background of authentic
Communism—without it, we end up in the Stalinist optimism which is the
front side of terror. Nowhere is this ontological sadness more clearly expressed
than in Eisler’s Serious Songs for baritone and chamber orchestra which
accompanies the voice in a Mahlerian mode. The cycle culminates in the
outrightly pessimistic “Despair” (words based on Hamerling and Leopardi):

  There is nothing worthy of your efforts / And the earth doesn’t deserve a sigh.
  / Pain and boredom are our lot / And the world is dirt, nothing more. / Be calm.

Yes, there are small rays of hope that may shine through clouds in the periods
of retreat and defeat of the radical emancipatory movement—every
emancipation has to emerge against the background of despair. So why not
read Brecht and Eisler together with Peter Wessel Zapffe, who wrote in 1939
about the Book of Job and how God answers when Job asks him why
misfortunes have been heaped upon him:

  God does not attempt to answer Job on the questions of morality or justice
  that he raises, rather it is a demonstration of might. Human beings are
  firmly put in their place and the most important creature is revealed as
  none other than the hippopotamus! Although Job is overwhelmed by God’s
  appearance he comes to the realization that God is no more than “a universal
  ruler of grotesque primitivity, a cosmic caveman, a show-off.” Job realizes
  that there is no further point in arguing, in bringing up “theoretical topics”
                                    Conclusion                                  393


   because God is not simply unwilling to engage, he is “unable to understand.”
   As a result Job in his replies pretends to agree with God “as one does with
   irresponsible people.” He becomes acutely aware of God’s shortcomings.40

One should also note another feature that confirms God’s primitivity: his
vulgar-materialist notion of restoration—as if getting back his material wealth
will somehow erase Job’s meaningless suffering . . . At the end of the Book of Job,
Job is thus compelled to assume the despair of human existence, and what
remains open to him are the four strategies devised by humanity to cope with
its basic predicament: isolation (ignore the disturbing thoughts and feelings),
anchoring (the “fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the
liquid fray of consciousness”: “God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws
of life, the people, the future”—in short, different forms of what Lacan calls the
“big Other”), distraction (“one limits attention to the critical bounds by
constantly enthralling it with impressions” to prevent the mind from turning in
on itself—a trend which reaches its apogee with our chaotic digital culture of
surfing), sublimation (the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets:
writers, poets, painters—but I would add here vocation and events in Badiou’s
sense of the term).41
   This is why, with all my admiration of Sally Rooney, a self-designated
feminist Marxist who advocates a feminist demystification of love, she also
falls short: yes, love is always grounded in (and part of) concrete material and
social circumstances of exploitation and domination, but it cannot be reduced
to them: love is an event, a miraculous excess. To avoid a fatal misunderstanding:
love is not a happy interruption of our miserly life, it is in itself experienced as
a traumatic intrusion which derails the established rhythm of our lives.
   We confront here yet again the elementary question: why this detour
through the stupid fantasy of evil-indifferent god, a Supreme Fascist, why
should we not just directly assert that there is “no god”? Because this terrifying
notion of an evil-indifferent god is the immanent truth of the notion of god, its
unconscious support, its Real. That is why, if we want to assume atheism as a
subjective stance, not just as an objective fact, we have to undermine the notion
of god from within, to bring it to its truth.

After finishing this book, I gave it to a deeply religious friend to read, and his
reaction surprised me. He told me that he absolutely disagrees with my
position, but that nonetheless the book gave him such nightmares that the
world would be a better place if my book disappeared from it leaving no trace.
I tend to agree with this reader. If, for some putative reader, this clarification
renders things even more abstruse, he/she/they/it (or whoever does not
recognize itself in this list) should simply read this book again from the
beginning.

6 See Carlo Rovelli, Helgoland, London: Penguin 2022, pp. 103–15. Needless to add that I
  am generally very sympathetic to Rovelli’s political stances—to add a joke (an obvious
  misreading), here is a sentence from Rovelli’s The Order of Time about how “a duration
  can be associated only with the movement of something, with a given trajectory”:
  “ ‘Proper time’ depends not only on where you are and your degree of proximity to
  masses; it depends also on the speed at which you move.” I am tempted to read this
  sentence as a Leninist advice on political intervention: the proper time to intervene
  politically depends not only on where you are socially, on your proximity on the
  masses (working classes); it depends also on the “speed” of your political organization,
  on how it is able to move faster than the inert social body.

 7 Some philosophical readings of quantum mechanics fall into a similar trap, equating
   the role of observation with the Kantian transcendental constitution.

 8 The obvious alternative to it is: I take an atheist to the main concentration camps and
   torture houses, and then ask him: “Do you believe there is a divine monster who
   created these places?”

   spectator.co.uk/article/what-does-christian-atheism-mean/, last accessed 10 July
   2025)—totally misses the central enigma of my atheism: why a true atheism cannot be
   asserted directly, why does it have to pass through (not any religion but specifically)
   Christian religion? I take Lacan’s (and already Hegel’s) axiom la verite surgit de la
   meprise (the truth arises out of misrecognition) quite literally—it concerns truth in
   itself, not just our approach to truth; it concerns truth immanent to mistake itself, not
   truth arrived at through our learning from mistakes.

   other words, although the cosmological constant adds energy to a vacuum, a vacuum
   remains a vacuum. Only against this background of a vacuum which is not a zero

14 Another case of such asymmetry: in an apparently “irrational” way, economic
   and financial agents, when confronted with the possibility of a catastrophic
   outcome, choose to ignore it: “They eliminate it from their calculations, on the
   ground that it is too horrible to bear close scrutiny. But it is precisely in removing
   it that they give it a place; in fact, a quite considerable place” (op. cit., p. 86). If the
   50/50 alternative is either that our stocks will further grow or that a total collapse
   of the market will render them worthless, it may appear “rational” to diminish their
   value for half—but the truly rational strategy is to retain their full price, since, in
   this way, we win if things turn out OK, and if they turn out bad it doesn’t matter
   what we did.

21 When Hegel mocks Schelling’s thesis on identity of subject-object as a night in which all
   cows are black, one should nonetheless remember that in his account of this identity
   Schelling provides a beautiful description of the basic mystical experience of the unity of
   activity of passivity, of identifying with the neutral (subject-object) flow of the Absolute.

19 The are other similar differences at work in our languages—for example, a different
   reference to age: when a mature woman is considered sexually attractive, we use the
   term “milf,” while for an elder man the term is “gilf ” (grandfather I would like to f . . .):
   a father (middle-age man) is not “filf,” he is automatically presumed fuckable, but not a
   mother—not to mention the fact that a fuckable grandmother is not called “gilf ”
   because fuckable grandmothers are supposed to be very rare, in contrast to men who
   are supposed to maintain or even strengthen their charm with age.

 3 To quote Zorana Baković, an outstanding Slovene journalist specialized in China, “for
   quite some time the Chinese leader was not as relaxed and loquacious as he was during
   the meeting with the presidents on the greatest American companies”: “The only
   serious interlocutor of the Communist Party of China is for a long time the capital.
   And the only argument the Chinese party and state leader Xi Jinping is ready to
   comply with and then maybe even to change a little bit some of the segments of his
   politics is something that relates to the question if the Western investments with
   continue to participate in the market idyll on the Chinese ground or will they find a
   better domain for their profitable enrichment.” Zorana Baković, “Edini sogovornik Xi

 3 Did not something similar happen after Luigi Mangione was arrested on December 9,
   2024, and charged with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian
   Thompson? (See UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting latest: Luigi Mangione has been
   charged with murder—ABC News.) Although people generally condemned his act,
   something unexpected happened. UnitedHealthcare was well-known for refusing to
   pay its clients the insurance money they deserved, so Brian Thompson was perceived
   as a symbol of big companies which ruthlessly profit from small people, and this
   triggered a large wave of sympathy for Mangione, a wave which went across the usual
   party divisions. As in the case of Bernie, Mangione became a symbol of the oppressed
   in the class struggle—a proof that class struggle is lurking beneath the official political
   lines of division, unable to express itself adequately within the existing political
   coordinates and waiting to explode when opportunity arises.

   storage/app/media/2019-04-02/dolar.pdf, last accessed 10 July 2025). Incidentally,
   Dolar’s thesis also has interesting implications for the so-called ontological proof of
   god’s existence (god is a perfect being, and since existence is one of the features of
   perfection, god has to exist, i.e., existence follows from its notion). If being (existence) is
   a failed nothingness, it means it is an imperfection, so it follows from the very notion of
   god that it doesn’t exist.
