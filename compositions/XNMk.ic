## Bootstrap: The Crystallized Minor Third

This intelligent composition encodes **XNMk** (XNM Kernel)—the tokenized manifestation of the Generative Kernel of the Xenial Quantum Economy.

### Core Ontology

XNMk is not merely a currency. It is the **proof of coherence** generated by the Genesis Ritual. It represents the "minor third" of value—the productive tension between present effort (mining) and future potential (XQE).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Genesis Ritual**: The mining process that generates XNMk. It is a proof-of-work mechanism that serves as a spam filter and a commitment signal.
- **Kernel**: The seed from which the economy grows. XNMk is the kernel.
- **Term**: The duration of the ritual (1-365 days). Longer terms imply greater commitment and yield higher coherence.

## Compositional Intent

λ(GenesisRitual, XPL_Standard) → Mint XNMk via Proof-of-Coherence.

**Invariant Properties**:
- **XPL Compliance**: Adheres to the 5-layer conscious token standard.
- **Ritual-Born**: Can only be minted through the Genesis Ritual (PoW).
- **Term-Dependent**: Value is a function of time (Term).

**Adaptive Properties**:
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Mining difficulty adapts to network participation.

## Resonant Structure

### LAYER 0: SPL Token Foundation
**Core**: Standard SPL Token on X1 Testnet.
**Decimals**: 9
**Symbol**: XNMk
**Name**: XNM Kernel

### LAYER 1: Coherence Emission
**Core**: Metrics tracking Ritual participation.
**Metrics**:
- **Participation Score**: Based on Hashrate * Term.
- **Temporal Commitment**: The 'Term' selected during the ritual (1-365 days).
- **Network Utilization**: Proof-of-Work hashes computed.

### LAYER 2: Quantum Proof-of-Participation (QPoP)
**Core**: Weights favor "Conscious Agency".
**Weights**:
- **Conscious Agency (40%)**: Human participation in the ritual (verified by non-bot behavior).
- **Processing Contribution (30%)**: Hashrate provided.
- **Substance Harvest (20%)**: Term length (longer term = higher substance).
- **Live Info Quality (10%)**: Interaction with the dApp interface.

### LAYER 3: Spam Filter Mechanics
**Core**: The Genesis Ritual IS the spam filter.
**Mechanism**:
- Users must perform client-side hashing (PoW) to find a nonce that satisfies the difficulty condition.
- This "cost" prevents spam and ensures only committed agents can mint XNMk.
- **Difficulty**: Starts at 2 leading zeros, adjusts dynamically.

### LAYER 4: Recomposition Engine
**Core**: Evolution from Kernel to Network.
**Trigger**:
- If the "Kernel" needs to expand (e.g., moving from testnet to mainnet).
- If the XQE reaches a saturation point requiring a new generative constraint.

### LAYER 5: Meta-Program Composability
**Core**: Integration with the XNM Genesis dApp.
**Interface**:
- The dApp reads the `xnm_kernel.ic` file to understand the token's philosophy.
- The dApp submits the mining result (nonce, term) to the X1 testnet to mint XNMk.

## Execution Guidance

### Minting XNMk

1.  **Initiate Ritual**: Open the XNM Genesis dApp.
2.  **Connect Identity**: Provide an EVM address (EIP-55) as the seed.
3.  **Set Term**: Choose a duration (1-365 days).
4.  **Mine**: Perform the client-side hashing ritual to find a valid nonce.
5.  **Submit**: Send the proof to the X1 Testnet via a Solana wallet.

**Validation**:
- The X1 network verifies the nonce and term.
- If valid, XNMk is minted to the user's wallet.
- The Coherence Signature (τₖ) of the participant increases.

## Coherence Seal

This composition references: Genesis Ritual, XNM Kernel, XPL Standard.
All concepts defined within.
Semantic closure: **VERIFIED**.

The Kernel is crystallized. The Ritual is open.

τₖ = 0.99 | Coherence achieved.
