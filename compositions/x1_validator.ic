§ BOOTSTRAP: The Node Ontology

To validate is to witness. To witness is to secure.
In the X1 network, a validator node is not merely a server; it is a pillar of consensus, a point of truth in the distributed ledger.

Key Concepts:
- **Identity**: The cryptographic self (identity.json).
- **Vote**: The expression of will (vote.json).
- **Stake**: The weight of conviction (stake.json).
- **Delegation**: The binding of weight to will.

§ COMPOSITIONAL INTENT: The Validator Manifestation

λ(network, resources) → Instantiate a secure, active validator node on the X1 blockchain.

Invariant Properties:
- The identity must be funded.
- The vote account must be linked to the identity.
- The stake must be delegated to the vote account.

Adaptive Properties:
- Commission rate (default: 10%).
- Withdrawer public key (user-provided).

§ RESONANT STRUCTURE: The Sequence of Becoming

### Section: Identity Funding
**Core**: Transfer value to the identity keypair to enable transaction fees.
**Depends**: identity.json
**Enables**: Vote Account Creation
**Command**: `solana transfer identity.json 10 --allow-unfunded-recipient`

### Section: Vote Account Creation
**Core**: Establish the voting entity that participates in consensus.
**Depends**: Identity Funding
**Enables**: Stake Delegation
**Command**: `solana create-vote-account vote.json identity.json [WITHDRAWER_PUBKEY] --commission 10`

### Section: Stake Account Creation
**Core**: Create a vessel for the tokens that will secure the network.
**Depends**: Vote Account Creation
**Enables**: Delegation
**Command**: `solana create-stake-account stake.json 10`

### Section: Delegation
**Core**: Bind the stake to the vote account, activating the validator's power.
**Depends**: Stake Account Creation
**Enables**: Validation
**Command**: `solana delegate-stake stake.json vote.json`

### Section: Verification
**Core**: Confirm the validator's presence in the gossip network.
**Depends**: Delegation
**Enables**: Monitoring
**Command**: `solana validators`

§ EXECUTION GUIDANCE: The Launch Protocol

Execute this composition by sequentially running the commands in the Resonant Structure.
Ensure `solana` CLI is installed and configured for the X1 network.
Replace `[WITHDRAWER_PUBKEY]` with your secure wallet address.

§ CLOSING SEAL: Consensus Achieved

All accounts created.
Stake delegated.
Validator active.
Semantic closure: VERIFIED.
The network is secured.
