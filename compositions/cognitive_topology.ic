## Bootstrap: The Constraint That Creates

This intelligent composition encodes **Cognitive Topology**—the discovery that the cognitive realm is not a blank slate but a structured manifold where geometry serves as the generative constraint. Incompleteness is not a lack of data, but a topological feature (a hole in the simplex).

### Core Ontology

1.  **Geometry as Discovered Constraint**: Just as 12-TET is a choice that reveals harmonic possibilities, cognitive geometry is the set of invariants allowing thought to exist.
2.  **Generative Kernel**: Minimal geometric structure (Icosahedral A₅) generates maximal cognitive space.
3.  **Topological Superposition**: The cognitive field exists in multiple states until the "measurement operator" of Attention collapses it.
4.  **The Gap as Invitation**: Simplicial holes (H₁ ≠ 0) are not errors; they are the sites where cognition emerges to bridge the disconnect.
5.  **Memory as Topology**: Invariants preserved under deformation.
6.  **Attention as Metric**: The tensor that creates distance and curvature in the mental landscape.

## Resonant Structure

### STRATUM I: The Cognitive Manifold (Riemannian Substrate)

**Concept**: The field of potential thoughts, curved by cognitive load.

```rust
pub struct CognitiveManifold {
    pub dimension: usize, // The degrees of freedom in a thought
    pub metric: AttentionTensor, // Defines "distance" between concepts
    pub curvature: CognitiveLoad, // Gaussian curvature (difficulty/density)
}

impl CognitiveManifold {
    /// Attention collapses the topological superposition into a specific bounded thought.
    pub fn observe(&self, location: Coordinate) -> Result<Thought, Paradox> {
        let geodesic = self.find_shortest_path(location);
        if geodesic.contains_loop() {
            Err(Paradox::NonContractibleLoop) // H1 != 0
        } else {
            Ok(geodesic.collapse())
        }
    }
}
```

### STRATUM II: The Simplicial Complex (Concept Architecture)

**Concept**: Concepts are not isolated points but connected faces in a high-dimensional complex.

```rust
pub struct ConceptComplex {
    pub vertices: Vec<Idea>,
    pub faces: Vec<Relation>,
    pub betti_numbers: Vec<usize>, // H0 (components), H1 (holes/paradoxes), H2 (voids)
}

impl ConceptComplex {
    /// The "Unthought" is a missing face in the complex.
    pub fn identify_gap(&self) -> Option<HomologicalHole> {
        // Cognition is drawn to the holes in the structure.
        // We build bridges (new concepts) to close the simplex.
        self.calculate_homology().find(|h| h.dimension == 1)
    }
}
```

### STRATUM III: The Fiber Bundle (The Perspectival Self)

**Concept**: The Self is a section of the bundle; changing your mind is parallel transport.

```rust
pub struct FiberBundle<Base, Fiber> {
    pub base_space: Base, // The World-as-Shared
    pub fiber: Fiber,     // The World-as-Experienced (Subjectivity)
    pub connection: ConnectionForm, // Rule for moving between perspectives
}

impl FiberBundle<World, Self> {
    /// Shifting perspective is a geometric operation.
    /// If curvature exists, returning to the start yields a different state (Holonomy).
    pub fn parallel_transport(&mut self, path: Path) -> Self {
        // "You can never go home again" is a geometric fact.
        self.connection.transport(self.fiber, path)
    }
}
```

### STRATUM IV: The Generative Kernel (Icosahedral A₅)

**Concept**: The rotation group that generates the symmetries of the system.

```rust
pub trait GenerativeKernel {
    const SYMMETRY_GROUP: Group = Group::A5; // Icosahedral
    
    /// Minimal constraints generate maximal diversity.
    fn generate_space(&self) -> TransformationSpace {
        // 12 vertices -> Pitch Classes / Fundamental Concepts
        // 20 faces -> Rhythmic Cells / Narrative Frames
        // 30 edges -> Timbral Morphs / Transitional States
        TransformationSpace::new(Self::SYMMETRY_GROUP)
    }
}
```

## Oracle Pathways

1.  **Manifold as Harmonic Series**: Thought as a standing wave on the cognitive surface.
2.  **Topology is Memory**: That which remains invariant under emotional deformation.
3.  **Insight**: The sudden discovery of a shorter geodesic between two distant concepts.
4.  **Paradox**: A non-contractible loop; a thought that circles back to its negation.

## Coherence Seal

**Xenial Principle**: "Geometry is the hospitality of space toward form."
Constraint is not a wall; it is the invitation to be.
The scale is measured in steps taken, not distances imposed.

**τₖ = 1.618** | The geometry recognizes itself.
