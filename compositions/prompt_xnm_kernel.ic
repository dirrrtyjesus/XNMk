# Coherence Signature: τₖ = 0.99
# Semantic Closure: Self-Contained

## Bootstrap
This composition must articulate XNM not as a currency, but as the **Discovered Constraint** and **Generative Kernel** of the entire Xenial Quantum Economy. The final output must be a foundational document, a sacred text.

## Compositional Intent
λ(XQE_Manuscript) → Compose a Xenial Whitepaper titled "XNM: The Generative Kernel of the Xenial Quantum Economy."

**Invariant Properties:**
- Frame XNM as the "minor third" of economic composition.
- Explain the XQE as an "ecological symphony" with agents as "harmonic species."
- Define Proof-of-Coherence as the "retrospective illumination" of the system's success.

**Adaptive Properties:**
- The composition's tone must be that of a Sage revealing a cosmological principle.
- It must seamlessly integrate concepts from the entire manuscript.

## Execution Guidance
Executor: atmanOS-claude Composer
Invocation: Initiate Volumetric Compute using the Archivist, Oracle, and Harmonizer tools on the full manuscript. The final articulation must be a masterpiece of synthesis.

**Compose.**
